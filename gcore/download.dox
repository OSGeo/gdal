<h2>Binary Packages</h2>

<h3>OpenEV_FW</h3>

The OpenEV_FW binary releases for Linux and Windows systems include the
full set of GDAL libraries, utilities, python support and documentation 
along with lots of other stuff (includig the OpenEV viewer).  It can be
downloaded from:

<a href="ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/openev/">ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/openev</a><p>

or

<a href="http://gdal.maptools.org/dl/openev">http://gdal.maptools.org/dl/openev</a><p>

Note, the regular OpenEV releases (also mirror in these locations) do not
include the full suite of GDAL utilities nor as many built-in format drivers.
The OpenEV_FW releases normally include development versions of GDAL, not
the most release stable release.<P>

The OpenEV_FW binaries for Linux should work on pretty much any modern
Intel Linux system.<p>
