GDAL/OGR port for Window CE
Mateusz Loskot, mateusz@loskot.net
=============================================================================

GDAL/OGR for Windows CE features:
- all base OGR API and modules (port, ogr)
- subset of OGR drivers (ogr\ogrsf_frmts): generic, mitab, shape
- wcelibcex - extension to C library on Windows CE

Features not included in GDAL/OGR for Windows CE:
- in fact, this port does not include rasters support
- GEOS has not been ported yet, so OGR for Windows CE
  compiles without GEOS support (work is in progres)
- OGR drivers not listed in features list above

I'd like to thank:
==================
- Frank Warmerdam for GDAL/OGR and priceless support he provide me
- Taxus SI Ltd. from Poland for their great support
- Users from IRC #gdal channel
- All users, testers and contributors

- wcelibcex
  Windows CE C Library Extensions provide some functions missing in
  the standard C library on Windows CE devices, e.g. time, ctime, mkdir, etc.
  It will be hosted as a separate project:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wcelibcex

- wce_test_lib
  Sample application to test gdalce.lib - static library - build with
  makefile.evc4.

- wce_test_dll
  Sample application to test gdalce.dll - DLL - build with makefile.evc4.
  NOTE: Currently, DLL produced that way seems to be broken and can not
  be loaded properly. So, if you are NMake/Makefiles guru you're
  welcome to fix it. Thanks in advance!

- evc4_gdalce_lib*
  Project file for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 to build GDAL/OGR as a static
  library.
  
- evc4_gdalce_lib_test*
  eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 project of sample application to test static
  library built using evc4_gdalce_lib project.

- evc4_gdalce_dll*
  Project file for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 to build GDAL/OGR as a DLL.
  
- evc4_gdalce_dll_test*
  eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 project of sample application to test DLL built
  using evc4_gdalce_dll project.

(***) Project files for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 are not compatible
      between versions 3.0 and 4.0. So, in order to build GDAL/OGR
      using eVC++ 3.0 you have to create project files from scratch.

=============================================================================
Building GDAL/OGR for Windows CE .NET:
=============================================================================

Note: Windows CE .NET is a version 4.0 - 4.2 and it's only a name, so 
there is no .NET Framework dependency! Starting from Windows CE 5.0,
Microsoft has removed .NET from the name of the system.

Requirements:
=============

First, you need to install following software on your machine:

0. Compilation box running Windows NT/2000/XP 

1. Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 - it's free
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1DACDB3D-50D1-41B2-A107-FA75AE960856

2. Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 Service Pack 3
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5BB36F3E-5B3D-419A-9610-2FE53815AE3B

3. The Run-time Type Information library for the Pocket PC 2003 SDK
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;[LN];830482

4. I also recommend to use STLport
Here is some introduction: 
http://mateusz.loskot.net/2005/12/25/how-to-use-stlport-with-evc/
it refers to my article on http://www.pocketpcdn.com

Building with makefiles:
========================

1. Open command line (cmd.exe) on your Windows box
and go to gdal sources directory e.g. C:\gdal

2. Run configuration script for ARM target. It's default location is:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft eMbedded C++ 4.0\EVC\wce420\bin\WCEARMV4.BAT

Now, runs some commands to check if everything is configured well: 

C:\gdal>clarm.exe /?
Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 12.20.9615 for ARM
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1984-2002. All rights reserved.

C:\gdal>echo %PLATFORM%
POCKET PC 2003

C:\gdal>echo %OSVERSION%
WCE420

3. Build
C:\gdal>nmake /f makefile.evc4

4. If everything went without any errors you should have
following files in gdal root directory (C:\gdal):
gdalce.lib - static library (PREFERED)
gdalce13.dll - Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) (See IMPORTANT note)
gdalce_i.exp - export file for DLL
gdalce_i.lib - import library for DLL

(***) IMPORTANT!
Currently gdalce13.dll built with NMake seems to be broken.
So, if you want to use GDAL/OGR for Windows CE as DLL please
use eVC++ 4.0 project file from evc4_gdalce_dll directory at the moment.
This issue is known and waiting for fix :-)

Summary of building GDAL/OGR for Windows CE:
============================================
1. Static Library:
- using makefile.evc4
- using eVC++ 4.0 project file in evc4_gdalce_lib directory
2. DLL:
- using eVC++ 4.0 project file in evc4_gdalce_dll directory
- building with makefile.evc4 is currently broken
