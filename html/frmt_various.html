<h1>Various Support GDAL Raster Formats</h1>


<h2><a name="AIG">AIG -- Arc/Info Binary Grid</a></h2>

Supported for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform.  This format is the internal binary format for Arc/Info Grid, 
and takes the form of a coverage level directory in an Arc/Info database. 
To open the coverage select the coverage directory, or an .adf file (such as
hdr.adf) from within it.<p>

This driver is implemented based on a reverse engineering of the format.  See
the <a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/aigrid/index.html">format 
description</a> for more details.<p>

Note that another driver (<a href="#GIO">GIO</a>) is available for Windows 
platforms with ArcView installed.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aigrid/aigdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="CEOS">CEOS -- CEOS Image</a></h2>

This is a simple, read-only reader for ceos image files.  To use, select
the main imagery file.  This driver reads only the image data, and does
not capture any metadata, or georeferencing.<p>

This driver is known to work with CEOS data produced by Spot Image, but
will have problems with many other data sources.  In particular, it will
only work with eight bit unsigned data.<p>

See the separate <a href="#SAR_CEOS">SAR_CEOS</a> driver for access to 
SAR CEOS data products.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/ceos/ceosdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DOQ1">DOQ1 -- First Generation USGS DOQ</a></h2>

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform, and capture of the projection string.   This format is the old,
unlabelled DOQ (Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/doq1dataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DOQ2">DOQ2 -- New Labelled USGS DOQ</a></h1>

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform, and capture of the projection string.   This format is the new,
labelled DOQ (Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.<p>

This driver was implemented by Derrick J Brashear.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/doq2dataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DTED">DTED -- Military Elevation Data</a></h2>

GDAL supports DTED Levels 1, and 2 elevation data for read access.  Elevation
data is returned as 16 bit signed integer.  Appropriate projection (always
WGS84) and georeferencing information is also returned.   No other metadata 
is captured.
<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/dted/dteddataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="EFF">EFF -- Eosat Fast Format</a></h2>

Support for read access to EOSAT Fast Format data is available in GDAL.  
EOSAT datasets normally consist of one or more raster data files (eg. 
BAND1.DAT, BAND2.DAT, ...) and a header file which must be called HEADER.DAT.
To open the dataset select the HEADER.DAT file.<p>

Currently only the raster data is accessed.  Georeferencing, and other meta
data is ignored.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/effdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="EHdr">EHdr -- ESRI .hdr Labelled</h2>

GDAL support the ESRI .hdr labelling format for reading raw raster data
(often referred to as ESRI BIL format) for read-only access.  Eight, sixteen
and thirty-two bit integer raster data types are supported as well as reading
of the affine georeferencing transform.  Reading of projection definitions
is not supported.  Unrecognised options in the .hdr file are ignored.  To 
open a dataset select the file with the .hdr extension. <p>

This driver may be sufficient to read GTopo 30 data, and Geospot products.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/ehdrdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="GIO">GIO -- Arc/Info Binary Grid</a></h2>

This is a second implementation for reading, and writing Arc/Info grids, and
only works on Windows platforms with ArcView installed.  It uses the 
AVGRIDIO.DLL installed with ArcView to implement full access.<p>

This driver supports georeferencing bounds, but no projection definition. 
New coverages can be created with a code of GIO. <p>

Also see the <a href="#AIG">AIG</a> read-only driver available on all 
platforms.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aigrid/giodataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="GXF">GXF -- Grid eXchange File</a></h2>

This is a raster exchange format propagated by Geosoft, and made a standard
in the gravity/magnetics field.  The format is supported for read, and write
and includes support for georeferencing information, and projections. <p>

Details on the supporting code, and format can be found on the
<a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/gxf/index.html">GXF-3</a> page.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/gxf/gxfdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="HFA">HFA -- Erdas Imagine .img</a></h2>

GDAL supports Erdas Imagine .img format for read access.  The current
implementation ignores pyramid levels, georeferencing and metadata, but 
does support the image data types U8, U16, S16, and F32.<p>

This driver could be easily upgraded to include proper georeferencing
and projection support.   Encourage me if you need this.<p>

More information, and other tools are available on the
<a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/imagine/hfa_index.html">
Imagine (.img) Reader</a> page.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/hfa/hfadataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="HKV">HKV -- Atlantis HKV Blob</a></h2>

GDAL supports HKV Blob raster file format for read, update, and creation.
This format is primarily used internally to the Atlantis Scientific InSAR
processing system.<p>

To select an HKV dataset select the directory containing the <tt>attrib</tt>, 
and <tt>blob</tt> files for the dataset.<p>

Currently only the UTM projection is supported (georef.projection.name = utm),
with the affine transform computed from the lat/long control points.   In
any event, if GCPs are available in a georef file, they are returned with 
the dataset.<p>

Newly created files (with a type of <tt>HKV</tt>) are always just raw rasters
with no georeferencing information.  For read, and creation all data types
(real, integer and complex in bit depths of 8, 16, 32) should be supported. <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/hkvdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="MFF">MFF -- Atlantis MFF Raster</a></h2>

GDAL includes read, update, and creation support for Atlantis Scientific's
MFF raster format.  MFF dataset consist of a header file (typically with
the extension .hdr) and a set of data files with extensions like .x00, .b00
and so on.   To open a dataset select the .hdr file.<p>

Reading lat/long GCPs (TOP_LEFT_CORNER, ...) is supported but there is no
support for reading affine georeferencing or projection information.<p>

Unrecognised keywords from the .hdr file are preserved as metadata. <p>

All data types with GDAL equivelents are supported, including 8, 16, 32 and
64 bit data precisions in integer, real and complex data types.  In addition
tile organized files (as produced by the Atlantis SAR Processor - APP) are
supported for reading. <p>

On creation (with a format code of MFF) a simple, ungeoreferenced raster
file is created.<p>

MFF files are not normally portable between systems with different byte orders.
However GDAL honours the new BYTE_ORDER keyword which can take a value of
LSB (Integer -- little endian), and MSB (Motorola -- big endian).  This may
be manually added to the .hdr file if required.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/mffdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="PAux">PAux -- PCI .aux Labelled Raw Format</a></h2>

GDAL includes a partial implementation of the PCI .aux labelled raw raster 
file for read, write and creation.  To open a PCI labelled file, select the
raw data file itself.  The .aux file (which must have a common base name) will
be checked for automatically. <p>

The format type for creating new files is <tt>PAux</tt>.  All PCI data types
(8U, 16U, 16S, and 32R) are supported.  Currently georeferencing, projections, 
and other metadata is ignored.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/pauxdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

Description</a><p>

<h2><a name="PNG">PNG -- Portable Network Graphics</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading, and creating .png files.  Greyscale, 
pseudo-colored, RGB and RGBA PNG files are supported as well as precisions of
eight and sixteen bits per sample.<p>

PNG files are linearly compressed, so random reading of large PNG files can
be very inefficient (resulting in many restarts of decompression from the
start of the file).<p>

Text chunks are translated into metadata, typically with multiple lines per
item. <p>

PNG files can be created with a type of PNG, using the CreateCopy() method, 
requiring a prototype to read from.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/png/pngdataset.cpp</tt>. 

PNG support is implemented based on the libpng reference library.  
More information is available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png.<p>

<h2><a name="SAR_CEOS">SAR_CEOS -- CEOS SAR Image</a></h2>

This is a read-only reader for CEOS SAR image files.  To use, select
the main imagery file.<p>

This driver works with most Radarsat and ERS data
products, including simple look complex products; however, it is unlikely
to work for non-Radar CEOS products.  The simplier <a href="#CEOS">CEOS</a>
driver is often appropriate for these.<p>

This driver will attempt to read 15 lat/long GCPS by sampling the per-scanline
CEOS superstructure information.  It also captures various pieces of metadata
from various header files, including:<p>

<pre>
  CEOS_LOGICAL_VOLUME_ID=EERS-1-SAR-MLD  
  CEOS_PROCESSING_FACILITY=APP         
  CEOS_PROCESSING_AGENCY=CCRS    
  CEOS_PROCESSING_COUNTRY=CANADA      
  CEOS_SOFTWARE_ID=APP 1.62    
  CEOS_ACQUISITION_TIME=19911029162818919               
  CEOS_SENSOR_CLOCK_ANGLE=  90.000
  CEOS_ELLIPSOID=IUGG_75         
  CEOS_SEMI_MAJOR=    6378.1400000
  CEOS_SEMI_MINOR=    6356.7550000
</pre>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/ceos2/sar_ceosdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="SDTS">SDTS -- USGS SDTS DEM</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading USGS SDTS formatted DEMs.  USGS DEMs are
always returned with a data type of signed sixteen bit integer.  Projection
and georeferencing information is also returned.<p>

SDTS datasets consist of a number of files.  Each DEM should have one file
with a name like XXXCATD.DDF.  This should be selected to open
the dataset.<p>

BUGS: <p>
<ul>
<li> Floating point SDTS DEMs are apparently not supported.<p>
<li> Projection definitions are currently returned in PROJ.4 format, instead
of OGC WKT format.<p>
</ul>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/sdts/sdtsdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>
