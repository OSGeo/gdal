Sample scripts
================================================================================

The following are sample scripts intended to give an idea of how to use GDAL's Python interface. Please feel free to use them in your applications.

From GDAL 3.2, Python utility scripts :ref:`programs` are located inside the ``osgeo_utils`` module.
From GDAL 3.3, Python sample scripts are located inside the ``osgeo_utils.samples`` sub-module.

.. warning:: Several of the sample scripts on this page have not been updated since they were created and may use outdated coding styles or deprecated APIs.

Python Sample Scripts
---------------------

The scripts provide examples of both raster and vector usage of the GDAL Python API.
