Build hints (cmake)
================================================================================

Build requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The minimum requirements are:

- CMake >= 3.10, and an associated build system (make, ninja, Visual Studio, etc.)
- C99 compiler
- C++11 compiler
- PROJ >= 6.0

But a number of optional libraries are also strongly recommended for most builds:
SQLite3, expat, libcurl, zlib, libtiff, libgeotiff, libpng, libjpeg, etc.

CMake
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the CMake build system you can compile and install GDAL on more or less any
platform. After unpacking the source distribution archive step into the source-
tree::

    cd gdal-{VERSION}

Create a build directory and step into it::

    mkdir build
    cd build

From the build directory you can now configure CMake, build and install the binaries::

    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --build . --target install

On Windows, one may need to specify generator::

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..

If a dependency is installed in a custom location, specify the
paths to the include directory and the library::

    cmake -DSQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/SQLite/include -DSQLITE3_LIBRARY=/opt/SQLite/lib/libsqlite3.so ..

Alternatively, a custom prefix can be specified::

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/SQLite ..

You can unset existing cached variables, by using the -U switch of cmake, for example with wildcards::

    cmake .. -UGDAL_USE_*

CMake general configure options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Options to configure a CMake are provided using ``-D<var>=<value>``.
All cached entries can be viewed using ``cmake -LAH`` from a build directory.

.. option:: BUILD_APPS=ON

    Build applications. Default is ON.

.. option:: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS

    Build GDAL library shared. Default is ON. See also the CMake
    documentation for `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
    <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html>`_.

.. option:: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

    Choose the type of build, options are: None (default), Debug, Release,
    RelWithDebInfo, or MinSizeRel. See also the CMake documentation for
    `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html>`_.

    .. note::
        A default build is not optimized without specifying
        ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` (or similar) during configuration,
        or by specifying ``--config Release`` with CMake
        multi-configuration build tools (see example below).

.. option:: CMAKE_C_COMPILER

    C compiler. Ignored for some generators, such as Visual Studio.

.. option:: CMAKE_C_FLAGS

    Flags used by the C compiler during all build types. This is
    initialized by the :envvar:`CFLAGS` environment variable.

.. option:: CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

    C++ compiler. Ignored for some generators, such as Visual Studio.

.. option:: CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS

    Flags used by the C++ compiler during all build types. This is
    initialized by the :envvar:`CXXFLAGS` environment variable.

.. option:: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

    Where to install the software.
    Default for Unix-like is ``/usr/local/``.

.. option:: CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

    List of directories specifying installation prefixes to be searched when
    external dependencies are looked for.

    Starting with CMake 3.12, it is also possible to use a
    ``<Packagename>_ROOT`` variable to define the prefix for a particular
    package. See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.12.html?highlight=root#commands

.. option:: ENABLE_IPO=OFF

    Build library using the compiler's `interprocedural optimization
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization>`_
    (IPO), if available, default OFF.

CMake package dependent options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. Put packages in alphabetic order.

Generally speaking, packages (external dependencies) will be automatically found if
they are in default locations used by CMake. This can be also tuned for example
with the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` variable.

Starting with CMake 3.12, it is also possible to use a
``<Packagename>_ROOT`` variable to define the prefix for a particular
package. See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.12.html?highlight=root#commands

Most dependencies that would be found can also be disabled by setting the
following option:

.. option:: GDAL_USE_<Packagename>:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Control whether a found dependency can be used for the GDAL build.

curl
****

.. option:: CURL_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to an include directory with the ``curl`` directory.

.. option:: CURL_LIBRARY_RELEASE

    Path to a shared or static library file, such as ``libcurl.dll``,
    ``libcurl.so``, ``libcurl.lib``, or other name.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_CURL=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use Curl. Defaults to ON when Curl is found.

ECW
***

Currently only support for ECW SDK 3.3 and 5.5 is offered.

For ECW SDK 5.5, ECW_ROOT or CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH should point to the directory
into which there are include and lib subdirectories, typically
ending with ERDAS-ECW_JPEG_2000_SDK-5.5.0/Desktop_Read-Only.

.. option:: ECW_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to the include directory with the ``NCSECWClient.h`` header file.

.. option:: ECW_LIBRARY

    Path to library file libNCSEcw

.. option:: ECWnet_LIBRARY

    Path to library file libNCSCnet (only needed for SDK 3.3)

.. option:: ECWC_LIBRARY

    Path to library file libNCSEcwC (only needed for SDK 3.3)

.. option:: NCSUtil_LIBRARY

    Path to library file libNCSUtil (only needed for SDK 3.3)

geotiff
*******

.. option:: GEOTIFF_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to an include directory with the libgeotiff header files.

.. option:: GEOTIFF_LIBRARY

    Path to a shared or static library file such as libgeotiff.so

.. option:: GDAL_USE_GEOTIFF=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use external libgeotiff. Defaults to ON when external libgeotiff is found.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_LIBGEOTIFF_INTERNAL=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use internal libgeotiff copy. Defaults to ON when external
    libgeotiff is not found.


HDF5
****

The HDF5 C library is needed for the HDF5 and BAG drivers. The HDF5 CXX library
is needed for the KEA driver.
The https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindHDF5.html module is used to
detect the HDF5 library.


JXL
***

JPEG-XL library used by the GeoTIFF driver, when built against internal libtiff.
Can be detected with pkg-config.

.. option:: JXL_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to an include directory with the ``jxl/decode.h`` header file.

.. option:: JXL_LIBRARY

    Path to a shared or static library file.


KEA
***

The KEA library is required for the KEA driver. The HDF5 CXX library is also
required.

.. option:: KEA_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to an include directory with the ``libkea/KEACommon.h`` header file.

.. option:: KEA_LIBRARY

    Path to a shared or static library file.


MRSID
*****

MRSID_ROOT or CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH should point to the directory of the SDK ending with
Raster_DSDK. Note that on Linux, its lib subdirectory should be in the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the linking of applications succeeds and libtbb.so can
be found.

.. option:: MRSID_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to the include directory with the ``lt_base.h`` header file.

.. option:: SQLITE3_LIBRARY

    Path to a shared or static library file, such as ``sqlite3.dll``,
    ``libsqlite3.so``, ``sqlite3.lib`` or other name.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_SQLITE3=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use SQLite3. Defaults to ON when SQLite3 is found.


TIFF
****

.. option:: TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR

    Path to an include directory with the ``tiff.h`` header file.

.. option:: TIFF_LIBRARY_RELEASE

    Path to a shared or static library file, such as ``tiff.dll``,

    ``TIFF_LIBRARY_DEBUG`` can also be specified to a similar library for
    building Debug releases.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_TIFF=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use external libtiff. Defaults to ON when external libtiff is found.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_LIBTIFF_INTERNAL=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use internal libtiff copy. Defaults to ON when external
    libtiff is not found.


TileDB
******

Specify install prefix in the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` variable.


OpenEXR
*******

Specify ``OpenEXR_ROOT`` variable pointing to the parent directory of 
/lib and /include subdirectories, i.e. /DEV/lib/openexr-3.0.
For OpenEXR >= 3 additionally specify ``Imath_ROOT`` as this is a 
separate library now, i.e. /DEV/lib/imath-3.1.3

or

Specify root directory adding to the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` variable to find OpenEXR's pkgconfig. 
For example -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/DEV/lib/openexr-3.0;/DEV/lib/imath-3.1.3

or

``OpenEXR_INCLUDE_DIR``, ``Imath_INCLUDE_DIR``, 
``OpenEXR_LIBRARY``, ``OpenEXR_UTIL_LIBRARY``, 
``OpenEXR_HALF_LIBRARY``, ``OpenEXR_IEX_LIBRARY`` 
explicitly


Selection of drivers
++++++++++++++++++++

By default, all drivers that have their build requirements satisfied will be
built-in in the GDAL core library.

The following options are available to select a subset of drivers:

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON/OFF

.. option:: OGR_ENABLE_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Independently of options that control global behavior, drivers can be individually
    enabled or disabled with those options.

.. option:: GDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=ON/OFF

.. option:: OGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Globally enable/disable all GDAL/raster or OGR/vector drivers.
    More exactly, setting those variables to ON affect the default value of the
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_<driver_name>`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_<driver_name>`` variables
    (when they are not yet set).

    This can be combined with individual activation of a subset of drivers by using
    the ``GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON``
    variables. Note that changing the value of GDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS/
    OGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS after a first run of CMake does not change the
    activation of individual drivers. It might be needed to pass
    ``-UGDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_* -UOGR_ENABLE_*`` to reset their state.


Example of minimal build with the JP2OpenJPEG and SVG drivers enabled::

    cmake .. -UGDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_* -UOGR_ENABLE_* \
             -DGDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=OFF -DOGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=OFF \
             -DGDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_JP2OPENPEG:BOOL=ON \
             -DOGR_ENABLE_SVG:BOOL=ON

Build drivers as plugins
++++++++++++++++++++++++

An important subset, but not all, drivers can be also built as plugin, that is
to say as standalone .dll/.so shared libraries, to be installed in the ``gdalplugins``
subdirectory of the GDAL installation. This can be useful in particular for
drivers that depend on libraries that have a license different (proprietary, copyleft, ...)
from the core GDAL library.

The list of drivers that can be built as plugins can be obtained with::

    cmake .. -L | grep -e "_ENABLE.*PLUGIN"

The following options are available to select the plugin/builtin status of
a driver:

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_<driver_name>_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON/OFF

.. option:: OGR_ENABLE_<driver_name>_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Independently of options that control global behavior, drivers can be individually
    enabled or disabled with those options.

    Note that for the driver to be built, the corresponding base
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_{driver_name}:BOOL=ON`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_{driver_name}:BOOL=ON`` option must
    be set.

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Globally enable/disable building all (plugin capable), GDAL and OGR, drivers as plugins.
    More exactly, setting that variable to ON affects the default value of the
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_<driver_name>_PLUGIN`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_<driver_name>_PLUGIN``
    variables (when they are not yet set).

    This can be combined with individual activation/deactivation of the plugin status with the
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_{driver_name}_PLUGIN:BOOL`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_{driver_name}_PLUGIN:BOOL`` variables.
    Note that changing the value of GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS after a first
    run of CMake does not change the activation of the plugin status of individual drivers.
    It might be needed to pass ``-UGDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_* -UOGR_ENABLE_*`` to reset their state.


Example of build with all potential drivers as plugins, except the JP2OpenJPEG one::

    cmake .. -UGDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_* -UOGR_ENABLE_* \
             -DGDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON \
             -DGDAL_ENABLE_FRMT_JP2OPENPEG_PLUGIN:BOOL=OFF

There is a subtelty regarding ``GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON``. It only controls
the plugin status of plugin-capable drivers that have external dependencies,
that are not part of GDAL core dependencies (e.g. are netCDF, HDF4, Oracle, PDF, etc.).

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS_NO_DEPS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Globally enable/disable building all (plugin capable), GDAL and OGR, drivers as plugins,
    for drivers that have no external dependencies (e.g. BMP, FlatGeobuf), or that have
    dependencies that are part of GDAL core dependencies (e.g GPX).
    Building such drivers as plugins is generally not necessary, hence
    the use of a different option from GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS.

Python bindings options
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. option:: BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Whether Python bindings should be built. It is ON by default, but only
    effective if a Python installation is found.

A nominal Python installation should comprise the Python runtime (>= 3.6) and
the setuptools module.
numpy and its header and development library are also strongly recommended.

The Python installation is normally found if found in the path or registered
through other standard installation mechanisms of the Python installers.
It is also possible to specify it using several variables, as detailed in
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/module/FindPython.html

GDAL also provides the following option:

.. option:: Python_LOOKUP_VERSION:STRING=major.minor.patch

    When it is specified, Python_FIND_STRATEGY=VERSION is assumed. Note that
    the patch number must be provided, as the EXACT strategy is used

Other useful options:

.. option:: Python_FIND_VIRTUALENV

    Specify 'ONLY' to use virtualenv activated.

.. option:: Python_ROOT

    Specify Python installation prefix.

Examples::

    cmake -DPython_LOOKUP_VERSION=3.6 ..
    cmake -DPython_FIND_VIRTUALENV=ONLY ..
    cmake -DPython_ROOT=C:\Python36 ..


The following options are advanced onces and only taken into account during
the ``install`` CMake target.

.. option:: GDAL_PYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX

    This option can be specified to a directory name, to override the
    ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` option.
    It is used to set the value of the ``--prefix`` option of ``python setup.py install``.

.. option:: GDAL_PYTHON_INSTALL_LAYOUT

    This option can be specified to set the value of the ``--install-layout``
    option of ``python setup.py install``. The install layout is by default set to
    ``deb`` when it is detected that the Python installation looks for
    the ``site-packages`` subdirectory. Otherwise it is unspecified.

.. option:: GDAL_PYTHON_INSTALL_LIB

    This option can be specified to set the value of the ``--install-lib``
    option of ``python setup.py install``. It is only taken into account on
    MacOS systems, when the Python installation is a framework.

Driver specific options
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. option:: GDAL_USE_PUBLICDECOMPWT=ON

    The :ref:`raster.msg` driver is built only if this option is set. Its effect is to
    download the https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/open-source/PublicDecompWT.git
    repository (requires the ``git`` binary to be available at configuration time)
    into the build tree and build the needed files from it into the driver.


Building on Windows with Conda dependencies and Visual Studio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is less appropriate for Debug builds of GDAL, than other methods, such as using vcpkg.

Install git
+++++++++++

Install `git <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_
