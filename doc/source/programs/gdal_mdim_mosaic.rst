    Build a mosaic, either virtual (VRT) or materialized, from multidimensional datasets.

.. Index:: gdal mdim mosaic

Synopsis
--------

.. program-output:: gdal mdim mosaic --help-doc

Description
-----------

:program:`gdal mdim mosaic` builds a mosaic a multidimensional array from a list of input GDAL multidimensional datasets,
that can be either a virtual mosaic in the :ref:`Multidimensional VRT (Virtual Dataset) <vrt_multidimensional>` format,
or in a more conventional multidimensional format such as :ref:`raster.netcdf` or :ref:`raster.zarr`.

The array to mosaic in the input datasets must:
- have the same name and path
- have the same data type and nodata value
- share the same number of dimensions, in the same order and with the same names.
- each dimension of the array must have an associate 1D numeric indexing variable.

A typical use case is when a multidimensional array is sliced into several files,
and it is desired to reconstruct the full array.

The program can support mosaicing along several axes.

There might be "holes" among the source datasets along the mosaiced dimensions,
and possibly overlaps (but only when regularly spacing along a mosaiced dimension)

Different typical use cases that can be addressed by this program are:

- a 3D array is sliced along a single dimension (for example a temporal one)
  into several files with each slice having a sample along that dimension. In
  that use case, the timestamps of the slices do not need to be regularly spaced.

- a 2D array is chunked/tiled along X and Y dimensions, with a regularly spacing
  along those X and Y dimensions, and where the coordinate values are aligned on
  the same grid among chunks.

The following options are available:

Standard options
++++++++++++++++

.. option:: -i, --input <INPUT>

   Input multidimensional dataset names. Required.

.. option::  -o, --output <OUTPUT>

   Output multidimensional dataset name. Required.

.. option:: -f, --of, --format, --output-format <OUTPUT-FORMAT>

    Select the output format. This can be a format that supports multidimensional
    output (such as :ref:`raster.netcdf`, :ref:`vrt_multidimensional`).
    When this option is not specified, the format is guessed when possible from
    the extension of the destination filename.

.. option:: --co, --creation-option <KEY>=<VALUE>

    Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
    used to control particulars about the file created.

    The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
    simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
    supported for a format can be listed with the
    :ref:`--format <raster_common_options_format>`
    command line option but the documentation for the format is the
    definitive source of information on driver creation options.
    See :ref:`raster_drivers` format
    specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.

    Array-level creation options may be passed by prefixing them with ``ARRAY:``.
    See :cpp:func:`GDALGroup::CopyFrom` for further details regarding such options.

.. include:: gdal_options/overwrite.rst

.. option:: --array <ARRAY>

    Name or full path of the array to mosaic. It must generally be specified,
    unless all input datasets have a single array with 2 or more dimensions.
