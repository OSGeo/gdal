    Combine together input bands into a multi-band output, either virtual (VRT) or materialized.


.. Index:: gdal raster stack

Synopsis
--------

.. program-output:: gdal raster stack --help-doc

Description
-----------

This program combine together input bands from GDAL datasets into a dataset, that can be
either a virtual stack in the :ref:`VRT (Virtual Dataset) <raster.vrt>` format,
or in a more conventional raster format such as GeoTIFF.

All bands of each input file are added as separate
output bands, unless :option:`-b` is specified to select a subset of them.

The list of input GDAL datasets can be specified at the end
of the command line or put in a text file (one filename per line) for very long lists.
Wildcards '*', '?' or '['] of :cpp:func:`VSIGlob` can be used, even on files located
on network file systems such as /vsis3/, /vsigs/, /vsiaz/, etc.

Stating with GDAL 3.12, this command can also be used as the first step of :ref:`gdal_raster_pipeline`.

Options
+++++++

The following options are available:

.. include:: gdal_options/of_raster_create_copy.rst

.. include:: gdal_options/co.rst

.. include:: gdal_options/overwrite.rst

.. option:: -b <band>

    Select an input <band> to be processed. Bands are numbered from 1.
    If input bands not set all bands will be added to the output.
    Multiple :option:`-b` switches may be used to select a set of input bands.

.. option:: --resolution {<xres,yres>|same|highest|lowest|average}

    In case the resolution of all input files is not the same, the :option:`--resolution` flag
    enables the user to control the way the output resolution is computed.

    `same`, the default, checks that all source rasters have the same resolution and errors out when this is not the case.

    `highest` will pick the smallest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.

    `lowest` will pick the largest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.

    `average` will compute an average of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.

    `common` determines the greatest common divisor of the source pixel dimensions, e.g. 0.2 for source pixel dimensions of 0.4 and 0.6.

    <xres>,<yres>. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
    Both must be positive values.


.. option:: --absolute-path

    .. versionadded:: 3.12.0

    When writing a VRT file, enables writing the absolute path of the input datasets. By default, input
    filenames are written in a relative way with respect to the VRT filename (when possible).

.. option:: --bbox <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax>

    Set georeferenced extents of output file. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
    If not specified, the extent of the output is the minimum bounding box of the set of source rasters.
    Pixels within the extent of the output but not covered by a source raster will be read as valid
    pixels with a value of zero unless a NODATA value is specified using :option:`--dst-nodata`
    or an alpha mask band is added with :option:`--add-alpha`.

.. option:: --target-aligned-pixels

    (target aligned pixels) align
    the coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values of the :option:`--resolution`,
    such that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent.
    Alignment means that xmin / resx, ymin / resy, xmax / resx and ymax / resy are integer values.

.. option:: --src-nodata <value>[,<value>]...

    Set nodata values for input bands (different values can be supplied for each band).
    If the option is not specified, the intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets
    will be used (if they exist). The value set by this option is written in the NODATA element
    of each ``ComplexSource`` element.

.. option:: --dst-nodata <value>[,<value>]...

    Set nodata values at the output band level (different values can be supplied for each band).  If more
    than one value is supplied, all values should be quoted to keep them together
    as a single operating system argument. If the option is not specified,
    intrinsic nodata settings on the first dataset will be used (if they exist). The value set by this option
    is written in the ``NoDataValue`` element of each ``VRTRasterBand element``. Use a value of
    `None` to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets.

.. option:: --hide-nodata

    Even if any band contains nodata value, giving this option makes the output band
    not report the NoData. Useful when you want to control the background color of
    the dataset. By using along with the :option:`--add-alpha` option, you can prepare a
    dataset which doesn't report nodata value but is transparent in areas with no
    data.
