"gdal" application
------------------

Starting with GDAL 3.11, parts of the GDAL utilities are available from a new
single :program:`gdal` program that accepts commands and subcommands.

.. warning::

    The :program:`gdal` command is provisionally provided as an alternative
    interface to GDAL and OGR command line utilities. The project reserves the
    right to modify, rename, reorganize, and change the behavior of the utility
    until it is officially frozen via PSC vote in a future major GDAL release.
    The utility needs time to mature, benefit from incremental feedback, and
    explore enhancements without carrying the burden of full backward compatibility.
    Your usage of it should have no expectation of compatibility until that time.
