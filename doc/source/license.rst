Some files are licensed under BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause or other non-copyleft
licenses. The full licensing terms are available in the `LICENSE.TXT`_ file.

Note however that GDAL can be built against many dependencies, each of them with
their own licensing terms (possibly LGPL, GPL or proprietary), hence the use of
a GDAL binary can be subject to less permissive licensing terms than MIT, and it
is the responsibility of users to check that they comply with the overall
licensing terms.
