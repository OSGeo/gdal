.. shortname:: MBTiles

.. build_dependencies:: libsqlite3

The MBTiles driver allows reading rasters in
the MBTiles format, which is a specification for storing tiled map data
in SQLite databases.

Starting with GDAL 2.1, the MBTiles driver has creation and write
support for MBTiles raster datasets.

Starting with GDAL 2.3, the MBTiles driver has read and write support
for MBTiles vector datasets. For standalone Mapbox Vector Tile files or
set of MVT files, see the :ref:`MVT <vector.mvt>` driver. Note: vector
write support requires GDAL to be built with GEOS.

GDAL/OGR must be compiled with OGR SQLite driver support, and JPEG and
PNG drivers.

The SRS is always the `Pseudo-Mercator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection>`__
(a.k.a Google Mercator) projection, EPSG:3857.

Starting with GDAL 2.3, the driver will open a dataset as RGBA. For
previous versions, the driver will try to determine the number of bands
by probing the content of one tile. It is possible to alter this
behavior by defining the :config:`MBTILES_BAND_COUNT` configuration option (or
starting with GDAL 2.1, the :oo:`BAND_COUNT` open option) to the number of
bands. The values supported are 1, 2, 3 or 4. Four band
(Red,Green,Blue,Alpha) dataset gives the maximum compatibility with the
various encodings of tiles that can be stored.

The driver will use the 'bounds' metadata in the metadata table and do
necessary tile clipping, if needed, to respect that extent. However that
information being optional, if omitted, the driver will use the extent
of the tiles at the maximum zoom level. The user can also specify the
:oo:`USE_BOUNDS=NO` open option to force the use of the actual extent of tiles
at the maximum zoom level. Or it can specify any of MINX/MINY/MAXX/MAXY
to have a custom extent.

The driver can retrieve pixel attributes encoded according to the
UTFGrid specification available in some MBTiles files. They can be
obtained with the gdallocationinfo utility, or with a
GetMetadataItem("Pixel_iCol_iLine", "LocationInfo") call on a band
object.

Raster creation issues
----------------------

Depending of the number of bands of the input dataset and the tile
format selected, the driver will do the necessary conversions to be
compatible with the tile format. When using the CreateCopy() API (such
as with :ref:`gdal_translate`), automatic reprojection of the input dataset to
EPSG:3857 (Pseudo-Mercator) will be done, with selection of the appropriate
zoom level.

Fully transparent tiles will not be written to the database, as allowed
by the format.

The driver implements the Create() and IWriteBlock() methods, so that
arbitrary writing of raster blocks is possible, enabling the direct use
of MBTiles as the output dataset of utilities such as gdalwarp.

On creation, raster blocks can be written only if the geotransformation
matrix has been set with SetGeoTransform() This is effectively needed to
determine the zoom level of the full resolution dataset based on the
pixel resolution, dataset and tile dimensions.

Technical/implementation note: in the general case, GDAL blocks do not
exactly match a single MBTiles tile. In which case, each GDAL block will
overlap four MBTiles tiles. This is easily handled on the read side, but
on creation/update side, such configuration could cause numerous
decompression/ recompression of tiles to be done, which might cause
unnecessary quality loss when using lossy compression (JPEG). To avoid
that, the driver will create a temporary database next to the main
MBTiles file to store partial MBTiles tiles in a lossless (and
uncompressed) way. Once a tile has received data for its four quadrants
and for all the bands (or the dataset is closed or explicitly flushed
with FlushCache()), those uncompressed tiles are definitely transferred
to the MBTiles file with the appropriate compression. All of this is
transparent to the user of GDAL API/utilities

Tile formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MBTiles can store tiles in PNG, JPEG or WEBP (since 3.8). Support for
those tile formats depend if the underlying drivers are available
in GDAL. By default, GDAL will PNG tiles.

It is possible to select the tile format by setting the creation/open
option TILE_FORMAT to one of PNG, PNG8, JPEG or WEBP. When using JPEG,
the alpha channel will not be stored.

PNG8 can be selected to use 8-bit PNG with a color table up to 256
colors. On creation, an optimized color table is computed for each tile.
The DITHER option can be set to YES to use Floyd/Steinberg dithering
algorithm, which spreads the quantization error on neighbouring pixels
for better rendering (note however than when zooming in, this can cause
non desirable visual artifacts). Setting it to YES will generally cause
less effective compression. Note that at that time, such an 8-bit PNG
formulation is only used for fully opaque tiles, as the median-cut
algorithm currently implemented to compute the optimal color table does
not support alpha channel (even if PNG8 format would potentially allow
color table with transparency). So when selecting PNG8, non fully opaque
tiles will be stored as 32-bit PNG.

Vector creation issues
----------------------

Tiles are generated with WebMercator (EPSG:3857) projection. It is possible
to decide at which zoom level ranges a given layer is written. Several
layers can be written but the driver has only write-once support for
vector data. For writing several vector datasets into MBTiles file an
intermediate format like GeoPackage must be used as a container so that
all layers can be converted at the same time. Write-once support means also
that existing vector layers can't be edited.

Part of the conversion is multi-threaded by default, using as many
threads as there are cores. The number of threads used can be controlled
with the :config:`GDAL_NUM_THREADS` configuration option.

Creation options
----------------

|about-creation-options|
The following creation options are available:

-  Raster and vector:

   -  .. co:: NAME

         the 'description' metadata item. If not specified, the basename of
         the filename will be used.

   -  .. co:: TYPE
         :choices: overlay, baselayer
         :default: overlay

         Strategy to determine
         zoom level. LOWER will select the zoom level immediately below the
         theoretical computed non-integral zoom level, leading to
         subsampling. On the contrary, UPPER will select the immediately
         above zoom level, leading to oversampling. Defaults to AUTO which
         selects the closest zoom level.

   -  .. co:: COMPRESS
         :choices: YES, NO
         :default: YES

         Whether to compress tiles with the
         Deflate/GZip algorithm. Defaults to YES. Should be left to YES for

         of features written.

   -  .. co:: CENTER
         :choices: <long\,lat\,zoom_level>

         Override default value for
         center metadata item, which is the center of :co:`BOUNDS` at minimum
         zoom level.

Layer configuration (vector)
----------------------------

The above mentioned CONF dataset creation option can be set to a string
whose value is a JSON serialized document such as the below one:

::

           {
               "boundaries_lod0": {
                   "target_name": "boundaries",
                   "description": "Country boundaries",
                   "minzoom": 0,
                   "maxzoom": 2
               },
               "boundaries_lod1": {
                   "target_name": "boundaries",
                   "minzoom": 3,
                   "maxzoom": 5
               }
           }

*boundaries_lod0* and *boundaries_lod1* are the name of the OGR layers
that are created into the target MVT dataset. They are mapped to the MVT
target layer *boundaries*.

It is also possible to get the same behavior with the below layer
creation options, although that is not convenient in the ogr2ogr use
case.

Layer creation options (vector)
-------------------------------

|about-layer-creation-options|
The following layer creation options are available:

-  .. lco:: MINZOOM
      :choices: <integer>

      Minimum zoom level at which tiles are
      generated. Defaults to the dataset creation option MINZOOM value.

-  .. lco:: MAXZOOM
      :choices: <integer>

      Maximum zoom level at which tiles are
      generated. Defaults to the dataset creation option MAXZOOM value.
      Maximum supported value is 22

-  .. lco:: NAME

      Target layer name. Defaults to the layer name, but
      can be overridden so that several OGR layers map to a single target
      MVT layer. The typical use case is to have different OGR layers for
      mutually exclusive zoom level ranges.

-  .. lco:: DESCRIPTION

      A description of the layer.

Overviews (raster)
------------------

gdaladdo / BuildOverviews() can be used to compute overviews. Only
power-of-two overview factors (2,4,8,16,...) are supported.

If more overview levels are specified than available, the extra ones are
silently ignored.

Overviews can also be cleared with the -clean option of gdaladdo (or
BuildOverviews() with nOverviews=0)

Vector tiles
------------

Starting with GDAL 2.3, the MBTiles driver can read MBTiles files
containing vector tiles conforming to the Mapbox Vector Tile format
(format=pbf).

The driver requires the 'metadata' table to contain a name='json' entry,
that has a 'vector_layers' array describing layers and their schema. See
:ref:`metadata.json <mvt_metadata_json>`

Note: The driver will make no effort of stitching together geometries for
features that overlap several tiles.
