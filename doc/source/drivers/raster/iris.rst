IRIS -- Vaisala's weather radar software format
================================================================================

.. shortname:: IRIS

.. built_in_by_default::

This read-only GDAL driver is designed to provide access to the products
generated by the IRIS weather radar software.

IRIS software format includes a lot of products, and some of them aren't
even raster. The driver can read currently:

-  PPI (reflectivity and speed): Plan position indicator
-  CAPPI: Constant Altitude Plan position indicator
-  RAIN1: Hourly rainfall accumulation
-  RAINN: N-Hour rainfall accumulation
-  TOPS: Height for selectable dBZ contour
-  VIL: Vertically integrated liquid for selected layer
-  MAX: Column Max Z WF W/NS Sections

Most of the metadata is read.

Vaisala provides information about the format and software at
http://www.vaisala.com/en/defense/products/weatherradar/Pages/IRIS.aspx.

NOTE: Implemented as ``gdal/frmts/iris/irisdataset.cpp``.
