E57: ASTM E57 3D file format (image part)
================================================================================

.. versionadded:: 3.13

.. shortname:: E57

.. built_in_by_default:: but the JPEG or PNG drivers must be available.

This is a read-only driver that reads 2D images potentially included in a
ASTM E57 3D file.

It does NOT read the point cloud part of such files. For that, you may use
`PDAL's E57 reader <https://pdal.io/en/stable/stages/readers.e57.html>`__.

Masks are combined with the JPEG/PNG image and reported as GDAL mask bands.

If a single JPEG or PNG image is included in the file, it is directly reported.
Otherwise if there are multiple images, opening the .e57 file will report several
subdatasets, whose connection string is of the form ``E57:"{filename.e57}":{image_name}``.

The XML descriptor contained in a E57 file can be accessed in the ``xml:E57``
metadata domain.

Checksums at end of E57 physical pages are not verified.
