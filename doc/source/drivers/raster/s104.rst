================================================================================
S104 -- S-104 Water Level Information for Surface Navigation Product
================================================================================

.. shortname:: S104

.. build_dependencies:: libhdf5

.. versionadded:: 3.9

This driver provides read-only support for water level data in the S-104 format,
which is a specific product profile in an HDF5 file.

S-104 files have two image bands representing water level height (band 1)
and water level trend (band 2) values for each cell in a raster grid area.

When opening a S-104 file, no raster band is directly available. But a list of
subdatasets will be reported, one for each timestamp available in the file.

An actual dataset can be opened through such a subdataset, with a syntax like
``S104:"filename.h5":Group_001``.

Georeferencing is reported.

Note that the driver currently only supports regularly gridded S104 datasets.

Open options
------------

|about-open-options|
The following open options are supported:

- .. oo:: NORTH_UP
     :choices: YES, NO
     :default: YES

     Whether the top line of the dataset should be the northern-most one.

     This is the default behavior of most GDAL formats, but the native
     organization of the data in S-104 products is to have the first line of
     the grid being the southern-most one. This native organization can be
     exposed by the driver by setting this option to NO (in which case the
     6th term of the geotransform matrix will be positive)
