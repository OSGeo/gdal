LIBKML Driver (.kml .kmz)
=========================

.. shortname:: LIBKML

.. build_dependencies:: libkml

The LIBKML driver is a client of
`Libkml <https://github.com/libkml/libkml>`__ , a reference
implementation of `KML <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/>`__
reading and writing, in the form of a cross platform C++ library. You
must build and install Libkml in order to use this OGR driver. Note: you
need to build libkml 1.3 or master.

Note that if you build and include this LIBKML driver, it will become
the default reader of KML for ogr, overriding the previous :ref:`KML
driver <vector.kml>`. You can still specify either KML or LIBKML as
the output driver via the command line

Libkml from Google provides reading services for any valid KML file.
However, please be advised that some KML facilities do not map into the
Simple Features specification OGR uses as its internal structure.
Therefore, a best effort will be made by the driver to understand the
content of a KML file read by libkml into ogr, but your mileage may
vary. Please try a few KML files as samples to get a sense of what is
understood. In particular, nesting of feature sets more than one deep
will be flattened to support ogr's internal format.

Datasource
----------

You may specify a datasource
as a kml file ``somefile.kml`` , a directory ``somedir/`` , or a kmz
file ``somefile.kmz`` .

By default on directory and kmz datasources, an index file of all the
layers will be read from or written to doc.kml. It contains a
`<NetworkLink> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#networklink>`__
to each layer file in the datasource. This feature can be turned off by
setting the environment variable LIBKML_USE_DOC.KML to "no"

StyleTable
~~~~~~~~~~

Datasource style tables are written to the
`<Document> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#document>`__
in a .kml, style/style.kml in a kmz file, or style.kml in a directory,
as one or more
`<Style> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#style>`__
elements. Not all of :ref:`ogr_feature_style` can translate into
KML.

Datasource creation options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following datasource creation options can be
used to generate a
`<atom:Author> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#atomauthor>`__
element at the top Document level.

-  **AUTHOR_NAME**
-  **AUTHOR_URI**
-  **AUTHOR_EMAIL**

The href of an
`<atom:link> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#atomlink>`__
element at the top Document level can be specified with the **LINK**
creation option.

The
`<phoneNumber> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#phonenumber>`__
element at the top Document level can be specified with the
**PHONENUMBER** creation option. The value must follow the syntax of
`IETF RFC 3966 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3966>`__.

Starting with GDAL 2.2, the DOCUMENT_ID datasource creation option can
be used to specified the id of the root <Document> node. The default
value is root_doc.

Feature
-------

An :cpp:class:`OGRFeature`
generally translates to kml as a
`<Placemark> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#placemark>`__,
and vice-versa.

If the model field is defined, a
`<Model> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#model>`__
object within the Placemark will be generated.

If the networklink field is defined, a
`<NetworkLink> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#networklink>`__
will be generated. Other networklink fields are optional.

If the photooverlay field is defined, a
`<PhotoOverlay> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#photooverlay>`__
will be generated (provided that the camera_longitude, camera_latitude,
camera_altitude, camera_altitudemode, head and/or tilt and/or roll,
leftfov, rightfov, bottomfov, topfov, near fields are also set. The
shape field is optional.

In case the PhotoOverlay is a big image, it is highly recommended to
tile it and generate overview levels, as explained in the `PhotoOverlay
tutorial <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/photos>`__. In
which case, the URL should contain the "$[level]", "$[x]" and "$[y]"
sub-strings in the photooverlay field, and the imagepyramid_tilesize,
imagepyramid_maxwidth, imagepyramid_maxheight and
imagepyramid_gridorigin fields should be set.

Placemark, Model, NetworkLink and PhotoOverlay objects can have an
associated camera if the camera_longitude, camera_latitude,
camera_altitude, camera_altitudemode, head and/or tilt and/or roll
fields are defined.

KML `<GroundOverlay> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#groundoverlay>`__
elements are supported for reading (unless the
LIBKML_READ_GROUND_OVERLAY configuration option is set to FALSE). For
such elements, there are icon and drawOrder fields.

.. _style-1:

Style
~~~~~

Style Strings at the feature level are Mapped to KML as either a
`<Style> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#style>`__
or
`<StyleUrl> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#styleurl>`__
in each
`<Placemark> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#placemark>`__.

When reading a kml feature and the environment variable
LIBKML_RESOLVE_STYLE is set to yes, styleurls are looked up in the style
tables and the features style string is set to the style from the table.
This is to allow reading of shared styles by applications, like
mapserver, that do not read style tables.

When reading a kml feature and the environment variable
LIBKML_EXTERNAL_STYLE is set to yes, a styleurl that is external to the
datasource is read from disk or fetched from the server and parsed into
the datasource style table. If the style kml can not be read or
LIBKML_EXTERNAL_STYLE is set to no then the styleurl is copied to the
style string.

When reading a kml StyleMap the default mapping is set to normal. If you
wish to use the highlighted styles set the environment variable
LIBKML_STYLEMAP_KEY to "highlight"

When writing a kml, if there exist 2 styles of the form
"astylename_normal" and "astylename_highlight" (where astylename is any
string), then a StyleMap object will be creating from both styles and
called "astylename".

Fields
------

OGR fields (feature attributes) are mapped to kml with
`<Schema> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#schema>`__;
and
`<SimpleData> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#simpledata>`__,
except for some special fields as noted below.

Note: it is also possible to export fields as
`<Data> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#data>`__
elements if the LIBKML_USE_SCHEMADATA configuration option is set to NO.

A rich set of environment variables are available to define how fields
in input and output, map to a KML
`<Placemark> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#placemark>`__.
For example, if you want a field called 'Cities' to map to the
`<name> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#name>`__;
tag in KML, you can set an environment variable.

Geometry
--------

Translation of :cpp:class:`OGRGeometry` to
KML Geometry is pretty strait forwards with only a couple of exceptions.
Point to
`<Point> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#point>`__
(unless heading and/or tilt and/or roll field names are found, in which
case a
`Camera <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#camera>`__
object will be generated), LineString to
`<LineString> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#linestring>`__,
LinearRing to
`<LinearRing> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#linearring>`__,
and Polygon to
`<Polygon> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#polygon>`__.
In OGR a polygon contains an array of LinearRings, the first one being
the outer ring. KML has the tags  
`<outerBoundaryIs> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#outerboundaryis>`__ and 
`<innerBoundaryIs> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#innerboundaryis>`__ to
differentiate between the two. OGR has several Multi types of geometry :
GeometryCollection, MultiPolygon, MultiPoint, and MultiLineString. When
possible, OGR will try to map
`<MultiGeometry> <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#multigeometry>`__
to the more precise OGR geometry type (MultiPoint, MultiLineString or
MultiPolygon), and default to GeometryCollection in case of mixed
content.

Sometimes kml geometry will span the dateline, In applications like qgis
or mapserver this will create horizontal lines all the way around the
globe. Setting the environment variable LIBKML_WRAPDATELINE to "yes"
will cause the libkml driver to split the geometry at the dateline when
read.

VSI Virtual File System API support
-----------------------------------

The driver supports reading and writing to files managed by VSI Virtual
File System API, which include "regular" files, as well as files in the
/vsizip/ (read-write) , /vsigzip/ (read-write) , /vsicurl/ (read-only)
domains.

Writing to /dev/stdout or /vsistdout/ is also supported.

Example
-------

The following bash script will build a
:ref:`csv <vector.csv>` file and a
:ref:`vrt <vector.vrt>` file, and then translate them
to KML using :ref:`ogr2ogr` into a .kml
file with timestamps and styling.
