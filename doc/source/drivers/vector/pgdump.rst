PostgreSQL SQL Dump
===================

.. shortname:: PGDump

.. built_in_by_default::

This write-only driver implements support for generating a SQL dump file
that can later be injected into a live PostgreSQL instance. It supports
PostgreSQL extended with the `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`__
geometries.

This driver is very similar to the PostGIS shp2pgsql utility.

Most creation options are shared with the regular PostgreSQL driver.

The PGDump driver supports creating tables with
multiple PostGIS geometry columns (following :ref:`rfc-41`)

Creation options
----------------

Dataset Creation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  .. dsco:: LINEFORMAT
      :choices: CRLF, LF

      By default files are created with the line
      termination conventions of the local platform (CR/LF on win32 or LF
      on all other systems). This may be overridden through use of the
      :dsco:`LINEFORMAT` dataset creation option which may have a value of **CRLF**
      (DOS format) or **LF** (Unix format).


Layer Creation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  .. lco:: GEOM_TYPE
      :choices: geometry, geography
      :default: geometry

      The :lco:`GEOM_TYPE` layer creation option can be set to one
      of "geometry" or "geography" (PostGIS >= 1.5) to force the type of
      geometry used for a table.

-  .. lco:: LAUNDER
      :choices: YES, NO
      :default: YES

      This may be "YES" to force new fields created on this
      layer to have their field names "laundered" into a form more
      compatible with PostgreSQL. This converts to lower case and converts
      some special characters like "-" and "#" to "_". If "NO" exact names
      are preserved. If enabled the table
      (layer) name will also be laundered.

-  .. lco:: PRECISION
      :choices: YES, NO
      :default: YES

      This may be "YES" to force new fields created on this
      layer to try and represent the width and precision information, if
      available using NUMERIC(width,precision) or CHAR(width) types. If
      "NO" then the types FLOAT8, INTEGER and VARCHAR will be used instead.
      The default is "YES".

-  .. lco:: DIM
      :choices: 2, 3, XYM, XYZM

      Control the dimension of the layer. Important
      to set to 2 for 2D layers with PostGIS 1.0+ as it has constraints on
      the geometry dimension during loading.

-  .. lco:: GEOMETRY_NAME

      Set name of geometry column in new table. If
      omitted it defaults to *wkb_geometry* for GEOM_TYPE=geometry, or
      *the_geog* for GEOM_TYPE=geography.

-  .. lco:: SCHEMA

      Set name of schema for new table. Using the same layer
      name in different schemas is supported, but not in the public schema
      and others.

-  .. lco:: CREATE_SCHEMA
      :choices: ON, OFF

      To be used in combination with
      :lco:`SCHEMA`. Set to ON by default so that the CREATE SCHEMA instruction is
      emitted. Turn to OFF to prevent CREATE SCHEMA from being emitted.

-  .. lco:: SPATIAL_INDEX
      :choices: NONE, GIST, SPGIST, BRIN
      :default: GIST

      YES/NO for earlier versions and backward compatibility: Set to GIST
      (GDAL >=2.4, or YES for earlier versions) by default. Creates a
      spatial index (GiST) on the geometry column to speed up queries (Has
      effect only when PostGIS is available). Set to NONE (GDAL >= 2.4, or
      FALSE for earlier versions) to disable. BRIN is only available with
      PostgreSQL >= 9.4 and PostGIS >= 2.3. SPGIST is only available with
      PostgreSQL >= 11 and PostGIS >= 2.5

-  .. lco:: GEOM_COLUMN_POSITION
      :choices: IMMEDIATE, END
      :default: IMMEDIATE
      :since: 3.7

      If set to IMMEDIATE (the default), geometry columns are created in the
      table structure as soon as OGR is instructed to create them (which typically
      means that the default geometry column is created just after the FID column
      and before the non-spatial columns). If set to END, the geometry columns are
      created in the table structure after non-spatial columns.

-  .. lco:: TEMPORARY
      :choices: ON, OFF
      :default: OFF

      Creates a temporary table instead of a permanent one.

-  .. lco:: UNLOGGED
      :choices: ON, OFF
      :default: OFF

      Whether to
      create the table as a unlogged one. Unlogged tables are only
      supported since PostgreSQL 9.1, and GiST indexes used for spatial
      indexing since PostgreSQL 9.3.

-  .. lco:: WRITE_EWKT_GEOM
      :choices: ON, OFF
      :default: OFF

      Turn to ON to write EWKT
      geometries instead of HEX geometries. This option will have no effect
      :config:`PG_USE_COPY` environment variable is to YES.

-  .. lco:: CREATE_TABLE
      :choices: ON, OFF
      :default: ON

      Set to ON by default so that tables are recreated
      if necessary. Turn to OFF to disable this and use existing table
      structure.

-  .. lco:: DROP_TABLE
      :choices: ON, OFF, IF_EXISTS
      :default: IF_EXISTS

      Set to ON so that
      tables are destroyed before being recreated. Set to OFF to prevent
      DROP TABLE from being emitted. Set to IF_EXISTS
      in order DROP TABLE IF EXISTS to be emitted (needs PostgreSQL >= 8.2)

-  .. lco:: SRID

      Set the SRID of the geometry. Defaults to -1, unless a SRS
      is associated with the layer. In the case, if the EPSG code is
      mentioned, it will be used as the SRID. (Note: the spatial_ref_sys
      table must be correctly populated with the specified SRID)

-  .. lco:: NONE_AS_UNKNOWN
      :choices: YES, NO

      Can be set to YES to force
      non-spatial layers (wkbNone) to be created as spatial tables of type
      GEOMETRY (wkbUnknown).
      Defaults to NO, in which case a regular table is created and not
      recorded in the PostGIS geometry_columns table.

-  .. lco:: FID
      :default: ogc_fid

      Name of the FID column to create.
      Starting with GDAL 3.7, if set explicitly to the empty string,
      disables the creation of a FID column.

-  .. lco:: FID64
      :choices: TRUE, FALSE
      :default: FALSE

      This may be "TRUE" to create a FID column
      that can support 64 bit identifiers.

-  .. lco:: EXTRACT_SCHEMA_FROM_LAYER_NAME
      :choices: YES, NO
      :default: YEs

      Can be set to
      NO to avoid considering the dot character as the separator between
      the schema and the table name.

-  .. lco:: COLUMN_TYPES

      A list of strings of format
      field_name=pg_field_type (separated by comma) that should be use when
      CreateField() is invoked on them. This will override the default
      choice that OGR would have made. This can for example be used to
      create a column of type
      `HSTORE <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/hstore.html>`__.

-  .. lco:: POSTGIS_VERSION
      :choices: 1.5, 2.0, 2.2

      Defaults to 2.2 starting with GDAL 3.2 (1.5 previously)
      PostGIS 2.0 encodes differently non-linear geometry types.
      And 2.2 brings special handling for POINT EMPTY geometries.

-  .. lco:: DESCRIPTION
      :since: 2.1

      Description string to put in the
      pg_description system table. The description can also be written with
      SetMetadataItem("DESCRIPTION", description_string). Descriptions are
      preserved by default by ogr2ogr, unless the -nomd option is used.

Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :copy-config:`PG_USE_COPY`

VSI Virtual File System API support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver supports writing to files managed by VSI Virtual File System
API, which include "regular" files, as well as files in the /vsizip/,
/vsigzip/ domains.

Writing to /dev/stdout or /vsistdout/ is also supported.

Example
~~~~~~~

-  Simple translation of a shapefile into PostgreSQL into a file
   abc.sql. The table 'abc' will be created with the features from
   abc.shp and attributes from abc.dbf. The SRID is specified.
   :config:`PG_USE_COPY` is set to YES to improve the performance.

   ::

      ogr2ogr --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump abc.sql abc.shp -lco SRID=32631

-  Pipe the output of the PGDump driver into the psql utility.

   ::

      ogr2ogr --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PGDump /vsistdout/ abc.shp | psql -d my_dbname -f -
