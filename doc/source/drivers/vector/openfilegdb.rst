.. _vector.openfilegdb:

ESRI File Geodatabase vector (OpenFileGDB)
==========================================

.. shortname:: OpenFileGDB

.. built_in_by_default::

The OpenFileGDB driver provides read, write and update access to vector layers of File
Geodatabases (.gdb directories) created by ArcGIS 10 and above (it has also
read-only support for ArcGIS 9.x geodatabases). The
dataset name must be the directory/folder name, and it must end with the
.gdb extension.

It can also read directly zipped .gdb directories (with .gdb.zip
extension), provided they contain a .gdb directory at their first level.

A specific .gdbtable file (including "system" tables) can also be opened
directly.

Curve in geometries are supported with GDAL >= 2.2.

Write and update capabilities are supported since GDAL >= 3.6

The driver also supports :ref:`raster layers<raster.openfilegdb>` since GDAL 3.7

Spatial filtering
-----------------

Since GDAL 3.2, the driver can use the native .spx spatial indices for
spatial filtering.

In earlier versions, it uses the minimum bounding rectangle included
at the beginning of the geometry blobs to speed up spatial filtering. By
default, it also builds on the fly a in-memory spatial index during
the first sequential read of a layer. Following spatial filtering
operations on that layer will then benefit from that spatial index. The
building of this in-memory spatial index can be disabled by setting the
:config:`OPENFILEGDB_IN_MEMORY_SPI` configuration option to NO.

SQL support
-----------

SQL statements are run through the OGR SQL engine. When attribute
indexes (.atx files) exist, the driver will use them to speed up WHERE
clauses or SetAttributeFilter() calls.

Special SQL requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"GetLayerDefinition a_layer_name" and "GetLayerMetadata a_layer_name"
can be used as special SQL requests to get respectively the definition
and metadata of a FileGDB table as XML content (only available in
Geodatabases created with ArcGIS 10 or above)

The "CREATE INDEX idx_name ON layer_name(field_name)" SQL request can be
used to create an attribute index. idx_name must have 16 characters or less,
start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore.

The "RECOMPUTE EXTENT ON layer_name" SQL request can be used to trigger
an update of the layer extent in layer metadata. This is useful when updating
or deleting features that modify the general layer extent.

The "REPACK" or "REPACK layer_name" SQL requests can be used respectively to
compact the whole database or a given layer. This is useful when doing editions
(updates or feature deletions) that may leave holes in .gdbtable files. The REPACK
command causes the .gdbtable to be rewritten without holes. Note that compaction
does not involve extent recomputation.

Configuration options
---------------------

The following :ref:`configuration options <configoptions>` are
available:

-  .. config:: OPENFILEGDB_IN_MEMORY_SPI
      :choices: YES, NO

      If ``YES``, an in-memory spatial index will be built instead of
      using the native spatial index. See `Spatial filtering`_.


Dataset open options
--------------------

-  .. dsco:: LIST_ALL_TABLES
      :choices: YES, NO
      :since: 3.4

      This may be "YES" to force all tables,
      including system and internal tables (such as the GDB_* tables) to be listed

Dataset Creation Options
------------------------

None.

Layer Creation Options
----------------------

-  .. lco:: FEATURE_DATASET
      :choices: <string>

      When this option is set, the new layer will be
      created inside the named FeatureDataset folder. If the folder does
      not already exist, it will be created.

-  .. lco:: LAYER_ALIAS

      Set layer name alias.

-  .. lco:: GEOMETRY_NAME
      :default: SHAPE

      Set name of geometry column in new layer.

-  .. lco:: GEOMETRY_NULLABLE
      :choices: YES, NO
      :default: YES

      Whether the values of the
      geometry column can be NULL. Can be set to NO so that geometry is
      required.

-  .. lco:: FID
      :default: OBJECTID

      Name of the OID column to create.

-  **XYTOLERANCE, ZTOLERANCE, MTOLERANCE**\=value: These parameters control the snapping
   tolerance used for advanced ArcGIS features like network and topology
   rules. They won't effect any OGR operations, but they will by used by
   ArcGIS. The units of the parameters are the units of the coordinate
   reference system.

   ArcMap 10.0 and OGR defaults for XYTOLERANCE are 0.001m (or
   equivalent) for projected coordinate systems, and 0.000000008983153Â°
   for geographic coordinate systems.
   ArcMap 10.0 and OGR defaults for ZTOLERANCE and MTOLERANCE are 0.0001.

-  **XORIGIN, YORIGIN, ZORIGIN, MORIGIN, XYSCALE, ZSCALE, ZORIGIN**\=value: These parameters
   control the `coordinate precision
   grid <http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/java_ao_adf/conceptualhelp/engine/index.html#//00010000037m000000>`__
   inside the file geodatabase. The dimensions of the grid are
   determined by the origin, and the scale. The origin defines the
   location of a reference grid point in space. The scale is the
   reciprocal of the resolution. So, to get a grid with an origin at 0
   and a resolution of 0.001 on all axes, you would set all the origins
   to 0 and all the scales to 1000.

   *Important*: The domain specified by
   ``(xmin=XORIGIN, ymin=YORIGIN, xmax=(XORIGIN + 9E+15 / XYSCALE), ymax=(YORIGIN + 9E+15 / XYSCALE))``
   needs to encompass every possible coordinate value for the feature
   class. If features are added with coordinates that fall outside the
   domain, errors will occur in ArcGIS with spatial indexing, feature
   selection, and exporting data.

   ArcMap 10.0 and OGR defaults:

   -  For geographic coordinate systems: XORIGIN=-400, YORIGIN=-400,
      XYSCALE=1000000000
   -  For projected coordinate systems: XYSCALE=10000 for the default
      XYTOLERANCE of 0.001m. XORIGIN and YORIGIN change based on the
      coordinate system, but the OGR default of -2147483647 is suitable
      with the default XYSCALE for all coordinate systems.
   -  ZORIGIN and MORIGIN: -100000
   -  ZSCALE and MSCALE: 10000

-  .. lco:: COLUMN_TYPES

      A list of strings of format field_name=fgdb_field_type
      (separated by comma) to force the FileGDB column type of fields to be created.

-  .. lco:: DOCUMENTATION
      :choices: <string>

      XML documentation for the layer.

-  .. lco:: CONFIGURATION_KEYWORD
      :choices: DEFAULTS, MAX_FILE_SIZE_4GB, MAX_FILE_SIZE_256TB

      Customize how data is stored. By default text in UTF-8 and data up to 1TB

-  .. lco:: CREATE_SHAPE_AREA_AND_LENGTH_FIELDS
      :choices: YES, NO
      :default: NO

      When this option is set,
      a Shape_Area and Shape_Length special fields will be created for polygonal
      layers (Shape_Length only for linear layers). These fields will automatically
      be populated with the feature's area or length whenever a new feature is
      added to the dataset or an existing feature is amended.
      When using ogr2ogr with a source layer that has Shape_Area/Shape_Length
      special fields, and this option is not explicitly specified, it will be
      automatically set, so that the resulting FileGeodatabase has those fields
      properly tagged.

Field domains
-------------

.. versionadded:: 3.3

Coded and range field domains are supported.

Relationships
-------------

.. versionadded:: 3.6

Relationship retrieval, creation, deletion and updating is supported.

Hiearchical organization
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.4

The hierarchical organization of tables and feature classes as top-level
element or within a feature dataset can be explored using the methods
:cpp:func:`GDALDataset::GetRootGroup`,
:cpp:func:`GDALGroup::GetGroupNames`, :cpp:func:`GDALGroup::OpenGroup`,
:cpp:func:`GDALGroup::GetVectorLayerNames` and :cpp:func:`GDALGroup::OpenVectorLayer`

Transaction support
-------------------

The driver implements transactions at the database level,
through an emulation (as per :ref:`rfc-54`). This works by backing up
the current state of the modified parts of a geodatabase after
StartTransaction(force=TRUE) is called.
If the transaction is committed, the backup copy is destroyed.
If the transaction is rolled back, the backup copy is restored.

Note that this emulation has an unspecified behavior in case of
concurrent updates (with different connections in the same or another
process).

Comparison with the FileGDB driver
----------------------------------

(Comparison done with a FileGDB driver using FileGDB API SDK 1.4)

Advantages of the OpenFileGDB driver:

-  Can read ArcGIS 9.X Geodatabases, and not only 10 or above.
-  Can open layers with any spatial reference system.
-  Thread-safe (i.e. datasources can be processed in parallel).
-  Uses the VSI Virtual File API, enabling the user to read a
   Geodatabase in a ZIP file or stored on a HTTP server.
-  Faster on databases with a big number of fields.
-  Does not depend on a third-party library.
-  Robust against corrupted Geodatabase files.

Drawbacks of the OpenFileGDB driver:

-  Cannot read data from compressed data in CDF format (Compressed Data
   Format).

Examples
--------

-  Read layer from FileGDB and load into PostGIS:

   ::

      ogr2ogr -overwrite -f "PostgreSQL" PG:"host=myhost user=myuser dbname=mydb password=mypass" "C:\somefolder\BigFileGDB.gdb" "MyFeatureClass"

-  Get detailed info for FileGDB:

   ::

      ogrinfo -al "C:\somefolder\MyGDB.gdb"

-  Get detailed info for a zipped FileGDB:

   ::

      ogrinfo -al "C:\somefolder\MyGDB.gdb.zip"
