GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source :ref:`license` by the `Open Source Geospatial Foundation`_. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing. The `NEWS`_ page describes the December 2025 GDAL/OGR 3.12.1 release.
