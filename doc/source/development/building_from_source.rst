Building GDAL from source
================================================================================

.. _build_requirements:

Build requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The minimum requirements to build GDAL are:

- CMake >= 3.16, and an associated build system (make, ninja, Visual Studio, etc.)
- C99 compiler
- C++17 compiler since GDAL 3.9 (C++11 in previous versions)
- PROJ >= 6.3.1

Additional requirements to run the GDAL test suite are:

- SWIG >= 4, for building bindings to other programming languages
- Python >= 3.8
- Python packages listed in `autotest/requirements.txt`

A number of optional libraries are also strongly recommended for most builds:
SQLite3, expat, libcurl, zlib, libtiff, libgeotiff, libpng, libjpeg, etc.
Consult :ref:`raster_drivers` and :ref:`vector_drivers` pages for information
on dependencies of optional drivers.

CMake (GDAL versions >= 3.5.0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since version 3.5.0, GDAL can be built using the CMake build system.
With the CMake build system you can compile and install GDAL on more or less any
platform. After unpacking the source distribution archive (or cloning the repository)
step into the source tree:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd gdal-{VERSION}

Create a build directory and step into it:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build

From the build directory you can now configure CMake, build and install the binaries:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --build . --target install

.. note::

    For a minimal build, add these options to the initial ``cmake`` command: ``-DGDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS=OFF -DOGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS=OFF``.
    To enable specific drivers, add ``-DGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>=ON`` or ``-DOGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>=ON``.
    See :ref:`selection-of-drivers` for more details.

.. note::

    The ``--prefix /installation/prefix`` option of CMake (>= 3.14) is supported since GDAL 3.7.0,
    but note that contrary to setting the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX at configuration time,
    it will not result in the GDAL_DATA path to be hardcoded into the libgdal binary,
    and is thus not recommended. It is also not supported on Windows multi-configuration
    generator (such as VisualStudio).


If a dependency is installed in a custom location, specify the
paths to the include directory and the library:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DSQLite3_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/SQLite/include -DSQLite3_LIBRARY=/opt/SQLite/lib/libsqlite3.so ..

Alternatively, a custom prefix can be specified:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/SQLite ..

It is strongly recommended (and sometimes compulsory) to specify paths on Windows
using forward slashes as well, e.g.: ``c:/path/to/include``.

You can unset existing cached variables, by using the -U switch of cmake, for example with wildcards:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake .. -UGDAL_USE_*

You can assemble dependency settings in a file ``ConfigUser.cmake`` and use it with the -C option.
The file contains set() commands that use the CACHE option. You can set for example a different name
for the shared lib, *e.g.* ``set (GDAL_LIB_OUTPUT_NAME gdal_x64 CACHE STRING "" FORCE)``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake .. -C ConfigUser.cmake

.. warning::

    When iterating to configure GDAL to add/modify/remove dependencies,
    some cache variables can remain in CMakeCache.txt from previous runs, and
    conflict with new settings. If strange errors appear during cmake run,
    you may try removing CMakeCache.txt to start from a clean state.

Refer to :ref:`using_gdal_in_cmake` for how to use GDAL in a CMake project.

Building on Windows
+++++++++++++++++++

On Windows, one may need to specify generator:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..


Building on MacOS
+++++++++++++++++

On MacOS, there are a couple of libraries that do not function properly when the GDAL build requirements are installed using Homebrew.

The `Apache Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html>`_ library included in the current distribution of Homebrew is broken, and causes a detection issue. In order to build GDAL successfully, configure CMake to not find the Arrow package:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Arrow=ON ..


Similarly, recent versions of Homebrew no longer bundle `Boost <https://www.boost.org/>`_ with libkml, causing a failure to find Boost headers. You should either install Boost manually or disable libkml when building on MacOS:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DGDAL_USE_LIBKML=OFF ..


CMake general configure options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Options to configure a CMake are provided using ``-D<var>=<value>``.
All cached entries can be viewed using ``cmake -LAH`` from a build directory.

.. option:: BUILD_APPS=ON

    Build applications. Default is ON.

.. option:: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS

    Build GDAL library shared. Default is ON. See also the CMake
    documentation for `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
    <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html>`_.

.. option:: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

    Choose the type of build, options are: None (default), Debug, Release,
    RelWithDebInfo, or MinSizeRel. See also the CMake documentation for
    `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html>`_.

    .. note::
        A default build is not optimized without specifying
        ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` (or similar) during configuration,
        or by specifying ``--config Release`` with CMake
        multi-configuration build tools (see example below).

.. option:: CMAKE_C_COMPILER

    C compiler. Ignored for some generators, such as Visual Studio.

.. option:: CMAKE_C_FLAGS

    Flags used by the C compiler during all build types. This is
    initialized by the :envvar:`CFLAGS` environment variable.

.. option:: CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

    C++ compiler. Ignored for some generators, such as Visual Studio.

.. option:: CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS

    Flags used by the C++ compiler during all build types. This is
    initialized by the :envvar:`CXXFLAGS` environment variable.

.. option:: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

    Where to install the software.
    Default for Unix-like is ``/usr/local/``.

.. option:: CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

    List of directories specifying installation prefixes to be searched when
    external dependencies are looked for.

    Starting with CMake 3.12, it is also possible to use a
    ``<Packagename>_ROOT`` variable to define the prefix for a particular
    package. See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.12.html?highlight=root#commands

.. option:: CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=OFF

    .. versionadded:: 3.9

    Default is OFF. This can be set to ON to build GDAL using the
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD.html feature.
    This helps speeding GDAL build times. This feature is still considered
    experimental for now, and could hide subtle bugs (we are not aware of
    any at writing time though). We don't recommend it for mission critical
    builds.

.. option:: ENABLE_IPO=OFF

    Build library using the compiler's `interprocedural optimization
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization>`_
    (IPO), if available, default OFF.

.. option:: GDAL_SET_INSTALL_RELATIVE_RPATH=OFF

    Set to ON so that the rpath of installed binaries is written as a relative
    path to the library. This option overrides the
    `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH.html>`__
    variable, and assumes that the
    `CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH.html>`__
    variable is not set.

CMake package dependent options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. Put packages in alphabetic order.

Generally speaking, packages (external dependencies) will be automatically found if
they are in default locations used by CMake. This can be also tuned for example
with the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` variable.

Starting with CMake 3.12, it is also possible to use a
``<Packagename>_ROOT`` variable to define the prefix for a particular
package. See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.12.html?highlight=root#commands
Note that the case of the package name matters for the _ROOT, _INCLUDE_DIR
and _LIBRARY variables.

Most dependencies that would be found can also be disabled by setting the
following option:

.. option:: GDAL_USE_<Packagename_in_upper_case>:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Control whether a found dependency can be used for the GDAL build.

It is also possible to ask GDAL to disable the use of any external dependency
(besides the required one, PROJ) by default by setting the following option to
OFF. Individual libraries shall then be enabled explicitly with
GDAL_USE_<Packagename_in_upper_case>:BOOL=ON.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBS:BOOL=ON/OFF

     Defaults to ON. When set to OFF, all external dependencies (but mandatory
     ones) will be disabled, unless individually enabled with
     GDAL_USE_<Packagename_in_upper_case>:BOOL=ON.
     This option should be set before CMakeCache.txt is created. If it is set
     to OFF after CMakeCache.txt is created, then cmake should be reinvoked with
     "-UGDAL_USE_*" to cancel the activation of previously detected libraries.

Some of the GDAL dependencies (GEOTIFF, GIF, JPEG, JSONC, LERC, OPENCAD, PNG, QHULL, TIFF, ZLIB)
have a copy of their source code inside the GDAL source code tree. It is possible
to enable this internal copy by setting the GDAL_USE_<Packagename_in_upper_case>_INTERNAL:BOOL=ON
variable. When set, this has precedence over the external library that may be
detected. The behavior can also be globally controlled with the following variable:

.. option:: GDAL_USE_INTERNAL_LIBS=ON/OFF/WHEN_NO_EXTERNAL

     Control how internal libraries should be used.
     If set to ON, they will always be used.
     If set to OFF, they will never be used (unless individually enabled with
     GDAL_USE_<Packagename_in_upper_case>_INTERNAL:BOOL=ON)
     If set to WHEN_NO_EXTERNAL (default value), they will be used only if no
     corresponding external library is found and enabled.
     This option should be set before CMakeCache.txt is created.


.. note::

    Using together GDAL_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBS=OFF and GDAL_USE_INTERNAL_LIBS=OFF
    will result in a CMake configuration failure, because the following libraries
    (either as external dependencies or using the internal copy) are at least
    required: ZLIB, TIFF, GEOTIFF and JSONC. Enabling them as external or internal
    libraries is thus required.


Archive
*******

JPEG
****

libjpeg is required for the :ref:`raster.jpeg` driver, and may be used by a few
other drivers (:ref:`raster.gpkg`, :ref:`raster.marfa`, internal libtiff, etc.)
If not found, an internal copy of libjpeg (6b) can be used.
Using `libjpeg-turbo <https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo>`_ is highly
recommended to get best performance.
See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindJPEG.html for more details
on how the library is detected.

.. note::

    directory of the installed binary into the PATH might not be sufficient.
    The reason is that when building from source, a "swig" binary will be
    generated, but FindSWIG will prefer a "swig-4.0" binary if found elsewhere
    in the PATH.


TEIGHA
******

The TEIGHA / Open Design Alliance libraries (closed source/proprietary) are
required for the :ref:`vector.dwg` and :ref:`vector.dgnv8` drivers.

    Control whether to use external libtiff. Defaults to ON when external libtiff is found.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_TIFF_INTERNAL=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use internal libtiff copy. Defaults depends on GDAL_USE_INTERNAL_LIBS. When set
    to ON, has precedence over GDAL_USE_TIFF=ON


TileDB

.. option:: ZLIB_IS_STATIC

    Link to static external ZLIB directory.
    Only used if GDAL_USE_ZLIB_INTERNAL=OFF and MSVC.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_ZLIB=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use ZLIB. Defaults to ON when ZLIB is found.

.. option:: GDAL_USE_ZLIB_INTERNAL=ON/OFF

    Control whether to use internal zlib copy. Defaults depends on GDAL_USE_INTERNAL_LIBS. When set
    to ON, has precedence over GDAL_USE_ZLIB=ON


ZSTD
****

`ZSTD <https://github.com/facebook/zstd>`_ is a compression library which offers
the lossless ZStd compression algorithm (faster than Deflate/ZIP, but incompatible
with it). It is used by the internal libtiff library or the :ref:`raster.zarr` driver.

.. _selection-of-drivers:

Selection of drivers
++++++++++++++++++++

By default, all drivers that have their build requirements satisfied will be
built-in in the GDAL core library.

The following options are available to select a subset of drivers:

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON/OFF

.. option:: OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Independently of options that control global behavior, drivers can be individually
    enabled or disabled with those options.

    .. note::

        <driver_name> above and below is *generally*, but not systematically the short driver name.

        Some drivers may also be grouped together for build purposes.

        - A number of "raw" raster drivers (ACE2, BT, BYN, CPG, CTable2, DIPEx, DOQ1,
          DOQ2, EHDR, EIR, ENVI, FAST, GenBIN, GSC, GTX, MFF2, ISCE, KRO, MFF, LAN,
          LCP, LOSLAS, NDF, NTv2, PAUX, PNM, ROIPAC, RRASTER, SNODAS) are controlled
          by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_RAW option.

        - Planetary raster formats (PDS, PDS4, ISIS2, ISIS3, VICAR) are controlled by
          the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_PDS option.

        - The AAIGRID, GRASSASCIIGRID and ISG raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_AAIGRID option.

        - The ECW and JP2ECW raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_ECW option.

        - The vector EEDA and raster EEDAI drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_EEDA option.

        - The GSAG, GSBG and GS7BG raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_GSG option.

        - The HDF5 and BAG raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_HDF5 option.

        - The MrSID and JP2MrSID raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_MRSID option.

        - The NITF, RPFTOC and ECRGTOC raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_NITF option.

        - The NWT_GRD and NWT_GRC raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_NORTHWOOD option.

        - The SRP and ADRG raster drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_ADRG option.

        - The Interlis 1 and Interlis 2 vector drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_ILI option.

        - The WFS and OAPIF vector drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_WFS option.

        - The AVCBIN and AVCE00 vector drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_AVC option.

        - The DWG and DGNv8 vector drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_DWG option.

        There might be variations in naming, e.g. :

        - the "AIG" raster driver is controlled by GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_AIGRID.

        - the "ESAT" raster driver is controlled by GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_ENVISAT.

        - the "GeoRaster" raster driver is controlled by GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_GEOR.

        - the "RST" raster driver is controlled by GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_IDRISI.

        - the "ElasticSearch" vector driver is controlled by OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_ELASTIC.

        - the "PostgreSQL" vector driver is controlled by OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_PG.

        - the "UK .NTF" vector driver is controlled by OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_NTF.

    .. note::

        Drivers that have both a raster and vector side (and are internally implemented by a
        single GDALDriver instance) are controlled by either a GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>
        option or a OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name> one, but not both:

        - The CAD drivers are controlled by the OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_CAD option.
        - The netCDF drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_NETCDF option.
        - The PDF drivers are controlled by the GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_PDF option.
        - The GPKG drivers are controlled by the OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_GPKG option.
        - The NGW drivers are controlled by the OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_NGW option.
        - The SQLite drivers are controlled by the OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_SQLITE option.

    .. note::

        The GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name> and OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name> options are
        only created when their required dependencies are found.


.. option:: GDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=ON/OFF

.. option:: OGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Globally enable/disable all optional GDAL/raster, resp. all optional OGR/vector drivers.
    More exactly, setting those variables to ON affect the default value of the
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>`` variables
    (when they are not yet set).

    This can be combined with individual activation of a subset of drivers by using
    the ``GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>:BOOL=ON``
    variables. Note that changing the value of GDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS/
    OGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS after a first run of CMake does not change the
    activation of individual drivers. It might be needed to pass
    ``-UGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_* -UOGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_*`` to reset their state.

    .. note::

        The following GDAL drivers cannot be disabled: VRT, DERIVED, GTiff, COG, HFA, MEM.
        The following OGR drivers cannot be disabled: "ESRI Shapefile", "MapInfo File", OGR_VRT, Memory, KML, GeoJSON, GeoJSONSeq, ESRIJSON, TopoJSON.

    .. note::

        Disabling all OGR/vector drivers with -DOGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS=OFF may affect
        the ability to enable some GDAL/raster drivers that require some vector
        drivers to be enabled (and reciprocally with some GDAL/raster drivers depending
        on vector drivers).
        When such dependencies are not met, a CMake error will be emitted with a hint
        for the way to resolve the issue.
        It is also possible to anticipate such errors by looking at files
        :source_file:`frmts/CMakeLists.txt` for dependencies of raster drivers
        and :source_file:`ogr/ogrsf_frmts/CMakeLists.txt` for dependencies of vector drivers.


Example of minimal build with the JP2OpenJPEG and SVG drivers enabled::

    cmake .. -UGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_* -UOGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_* \
             -DGDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=OFF -DOGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS:BOOL=OFF \
             -DGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_JP2OPENJPEG:BOOL=ON \
             -DOGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_SVG:BOOL=ON

Build drivers as plugins
++++++++++++++++++++++++

An important subset, but not all, drivers can be also built as plugin, that is
to say as standalone .dll/.so shared libraries, to be installed in the ``gdalplugins``
subdirectory of the GDAL installation. This can be useful in particular for
drivers that depend on libraries that have a license different (proprietary, copyleft, ...)
from the core GDAL library.

The list of drivers that can be built as plugins can be obtained with::

    cmake .. -L | grep -e "_ENABLE.*PLUGIN"

The following options are available to select the plugin/builtin status of
a driver:

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON/OFF

.. option:: OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Independently of options that control global behavior, drivers can be individually
    enabled or disabled with those options.

    Note that for the driver to be built, the corresponding base
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_{driver_name}:BOOL=ON`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_{driver_name}:BOOL=ON`` option must
    be set.

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Globally enable/disable building all (plugin capable), GDAL and OGR, drivers as plugins.
    More exactly, setting that variable to ON affects the default value of the
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>_PLUGIN`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_<driver_name>_PLUGIN``
    variables (when they are not yet set).

    This can be combined with individual activation/deactivation of the plugin status with the
    ``GDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_{driver_name}_PLUGIN:BOOL`` or ``OGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_{driver_name}_PLUGIN:BOOL`` variables.
    Note that changing the value of GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS after a first
    run of CMake does not change the activation of the plugin status of individual drivers.
    It might be needed to pass ``-UGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_* -UOGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_*`` to reset their state.

Example of build with all potential drivers as plugins, except the JP2OpenJPEG one::

    cmake .. -UGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_* -UOGR_ENABLE_DRIVER_* \
             -DGDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON \
             -DGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_JP2OPENJPEG_PLUGIN:BOOL=OFF

There is a subtelty regarding ``GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON``. It only controls
the plugin status of plugin-capable drivers that have external dependencies,
that are not part of GDAL core dependencies (e.g. are netCDF, HDF4, Oracle, PDF, etc.).

.. option:: GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS_NO_DEPS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Globally enable/disable building all (plugin capable), GDAL and OGR, drivers as plugins,
    for drivers that have no external dependencies (e.g. BMP, FlatGeobuf), or that have
    dependencies that are part of GDAL core dependencies (e.g GPX).
    Building such drivers as plugins is generally not necessary, hence
    the use of a different option from GDAL_ENABLE_PLUGINS.

In some circumstances, it might be desirable to prevent loading of GDAL plugins.
This can be done with:

.. option:: GDAL_AUTOLOAD_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Set to OFF to disable loading of GDAL plugins. Default is ON.


Deferred loaded plugins
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Starting with GDAL 3.9, a number of in-tree drivers, that can be built as
plugins, are loaded in a deferred way. This involves that some part of their
code, which does not depend on external libraries, is included in core libgdal,
whereas most of the driver code is in a separated dynamically loaded library.
For builds where libgdal and its plugins are built in a single operation, this
is fully transparent to the user.

When a plugin driver is known of core libgdal, but not available as a plugin at
runtime, GDAL will inform the user that the plugin is not available, but could
be installed. It is possible to give more hints on how to install a plugin
by setting the following option:

.. option:: GDAL_DRIVER_<driver_name>_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_MESSAGE:STRING

.. option:: OGR_DRIVER_<driver_name>_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_MESSAGE:STRING

    Custom message to give a hint to the user how to install a missing plugin


For example, if doing a build with::

    cmake .. -DOGR_DRIVER_PARQUET_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_MESSAGE="You may install it with with 'conda install -c conda-forge libgdal-arrow-parquet'"

and opening a Parquet file while the plugin is not installed will display the
following error::

    $ ogrinfo poly.parquet
    ERROR 4: `poly.parquet' not recognized as a supported file format. It could have been recognized by driver Parquet, but plugin ogr_Parquet.so is not available in your installation. You may install it with with 'conda install -c conda-forge libgdal-arrow-parquet'


For more specific builds where libgdal would be first built, and then plugin
drivers built in later incremental builds, this approach would not work, given
that the core libgdal built initially would lack code needed to declare the
plugin(s).

In that situation, the user building GDAL will need to explicitly declare at
initial libgdal build time that one or several plugin(s) will be later built.
Note that it is safe to distribute such a libgdal library, even if the plugins
are not always available at runtime.

This can be done with the following option:

.. option:: GDAL_REGISTER_DRIVER_<driver_name>_FOR_LATER_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON

.. option:: OGR_REGISTER_DRIVER_<driver_name>_FOR_LATER_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON

    Declares that a driver will be later built as a plugin.

Setting this option to drivers not ready for it will lead to an explicit
CMake error.


For some drivers (ECW, HEIF, JP2KAK, JPEG, JPEGXL, KEA, LERC, MrSID,
MSSQLSpatial, netCDF, OpenJPEG, PDF, TileDB, WEBP), the metadata and/or dataset
identification code embedded on libgdal, will depend on optional capabilities
of the dependent library (e.g. libnetcdf for netCDF)
In that situation, it is desirable that the dependent library is available at
CMake configuration time for the core libgdal built, but disabled with
GDAL_USE_<driver_name>=OFF. It must of course be re-enabled later when the plugin is
built.

For example for netCDF::

    cmake .. -DGDAL_REGISTER_DRIVER_NETCDF_FOR_LATER_PLUGIN=ON -DGDAL_USE_NETCDF=OFF
    cmake --build .

    cmake .. -DGDAL_USE_NETCDF=ON -DGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_NETCDF=ON -DGDAL_ENABLE_DRIVER_NETCDF_PLUGIN=ON
    cmake --build . --target gdal_netCDF


For other drivers, GDAL_REGISTER_DRIVER_<driver_name>_FOR_LATER_PLUGIN /
OGR_REGISTER_DRIVER_<driver_name>_FOR_LATER_PLUGIN can be declared at
libgdal build time without requiring the dependent libraries needed to build
the plugin later to be available.

Out-of-tree deferred loaded plugins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Out-of-tree drivers can also benefit from the deferred loading capability, provided
libgdal is built with CMake variable(s) pointing to external code containing the
code for registering a proxy driver.

This can be done with the following option:

.. option:: ADD_EXTERNAL_DEFERRED_PLUGIN_<driver_name>:FILEPATH=/path/to/some/file.cpp

The pointed file must declare a ``void DeclareDeferred<driver_name>(void)``
method with C linkage that takes care of creating a GDALPluginDriverProxy
instance and calling :cpp:func:`GDALDriverManager::DeclareDeferredPluginDriver` on it.

.. _building-python-bindings:

Python bindings options
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. option:: BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Whether Python bindings should be built. It is ON by default, but only
    effective if a Python installation is found.

A nominal Python installation should comprise the Python runtime (>= 3.6) and
the setuptools module.
numpy and its header and development library are also strongly recommended.

The Python installation is normally found if found in the path or registered
through other standard installation mechanisms of the Python installers.
It is also possible to specify it using several variables, as detailed in
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/module/FindPython.html

GDAL also provides the following option:

.. option:: Python_LOOKUP_VERSION:STRING=major.minor.patch

    When it is specified, Python_FIND_STRATEGY=VERSION is assumed. Note that
    the patch number must be provided, as the EXACT strategy is used

Other useful options:

.. option:: Python_FIND_VIRTUALENV

    Specify 'ONLY' to use virtualenv activated.

.. option:: Python_ROOT

    Specify Python installation prefix.

Examples::

    cmake -DPython_LOOKUP_VERSION=3.6.0 ..
    cmake -DPython_FIND_VIRTUALENV=ONLY ..
    cmake -DPython_ROOT=C:\Python36 ..


The following options are advanced ones and only taken into account during
the ``install`` CMake target.

.. option:: GDAL_PYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX

    This option can be specified to a directory name, to override the
    ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` option.
    It is used to set the value of the ``--prefix`` option of ``python3 setup.py install``.

.. option:: GDAL_PYTHON_INSTALL_LAYOUT

    This option can be specified to set the value of the ``--install-layout``
    option of ``python3 setup.py install``. The install layout is by default set to
    ``deb`` when it is detected that the Python installation looks for
    the ``site-packages`` subdirectory. Otherwise it is unspecified.

.. option:: GDAL_PYTHON_INSTALL_LIB

    This option can be specified to set the value of the ``--install-lib``
    option of ``python3 setup.py install``. It is only taken into account on
    MacOS systems, when the Python installation is a framework.

.. note::

    The Python bindings are made of several modules (osgeo.gdal, osgeo.ogr, etc.)
    which link each against libgdal. Consequently, a static build of libgdal is
    not compatible with the bindings.

.. _building_from_source_java:

Java bindings options
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. option:: BUILD_JAVA_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Whether Java bindings should be built. It is ON by default, but only
    effective if Java runtime and development packages are found.
    The relevant options that can be set are described in
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindJava.html and
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindJNI.html.
    The ``ant`` binary must also be available in the PATH.

.. option:: GDAL_JAVA_INSTALL_DIR

    Subdirectory into which to install the :file:`gdal.jar` file.
    It defaults to "${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}/java"

    .. note::
        Prior to GDAL 3.8, the gdalalljni library was also installed in that
        directory. Starting with GDAL 3.8, this is controlled by the
        ``GDAL_JAVA_JNI_INSTALL_DIR`` variable.

.. option:: GDAL_JAVA_JNI_INSTALL_DIR

    .. versionadded:: 3.8

    Subdirectory into which to install the :file:`libgdalalljni.so` /
    :file:`libgdalalljni.dylib` / :file:`gdalalljni.dll` library.
    It defaults to "${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/jni".

    .. note::
        Prior to GDAL 3.8, the gdalalljni library was installed in the
        directory controlled by the ``GDAL_JAVA_INSTALL_DIR`` variable.


.. note::

    The Java bindings are made of several modules (org.osgeo.gdal, org.osgeo.ogr, etc.)
    which link each against libgdal. Consequently, a static build of libgdal is
    not compatible with the bindings.

Option only to be used by maintainers:

.. option:: GPG_KEY

    GPG key to sign build artifacts. Needed to generate bundle.jar.

.. option:: GPG_PASS

    GPG pass phrase to sign build artifacts.

C# bindings options
+++++++++++++++++++

For more details on how to build and use the C# bindings read the dedicated section :ref:`csharp_compile_cmake`.

.. option:: BUILD_CSHARP_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON/OFF

    Whether C# bindings should be built. It is ON by default, but only
    effective if C# runtime and development packages are found. Either .NET
    SDK can be used or Mono. The relevant options that can be set are described
    in ``cmake/modules/thirdparty/FindDotNetFrameworkSdk.cmake`` and
    ``cmake/modules/thirdparty/FindMono.cmake``.

.. option:: CSHARP_MONO=ON/OFF

    Forces the use of Mono as opposed to .NET to compile the C# bindings.

.. option:: CSHARP_LIBRARY_VERSION

    Sets the .NET (or Mono) target SDK to be used when compiling the C# binding libraries. `List of acceptable contents for .NET <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks#supported-target-frameworks>`_

.. option:: CSHARP_APPLICATION_VERSION

    Sets the .NET (or Mono) target SDK to be used when compiling the C# sample applications. `List of acceptable contents for .NET <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks#supported-target-frameworks>`_

.. option:: GDAL_CSHARP_ONLY=OFF/ON

    Build the C# bindings without building GDAL. This should be used when building the bindings on top of an existing GDAL installation - for instance on top of the CONDA package.

.. note::

    The C# bindings are made of several modules (OSGeo.GDAL, OSGeo.OGR, etc.)
    which link each against libgdal. Consequently, a static build of libgdal is
    not compatible with the bindings.

Driver specific options
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. option:: GDAL_USE_PUBLICDECOMPWT

    The :ref:`raster.msg` driver is built only if this option is set to ON (default is OFF).
    Its effect is to download the https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/open-source/PublicDecompWT.git
    repository (requires the ``git`` binary to be available at configuration time)
    into the build tree and build the needed files from it into the driver.


Cross-compiling for Android
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First refer to https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html#cross-compiling-for-android
and to :source_file:`.github/workflows/android_cmake/start.sh` for
an example of a build script to cross-compile from Ubuntu.


Typical build issues
++++++++++++++++++++

How do I get PROJ ?
*******************

PROJ is the only required build-time dependency of GDAL that is not vendorized
in the GDAL source code tree. Consequently, the PROJ header and library must be available
when configuring GDAL's CMake. Consult `PROJ installation <https://proj.org/install.html>`__.

Conflicting PROJ libraries
**************************

If using a custom PROJ build (that is a PROJ build that does not come from
a distribution channel), it can sometimes happen that this custom PROJ build
conflicts with packaged dependencies, such as spatialite or libgeotiff, that
themselves link to another copy of PROJ.

The clean way to solve this is to rebuild from sources those other libraries
against the custom PROJ build.
For Linux based systems, given that C API/ABI has been preserved in the
PROJ 6, 7, 8, 9 series, if the custom PROJ build is more recent than the
PROJ used by those other libraries, doing aliases of the older ``libproj.so.XX``
name to the newer ``libproj.so.YY`` (with ``ln -s``) should work, although it is
definitely not recommended to use this solution in a production environment.

In any case, if ``ldd libgdal.so | grep libproj`` reports more than one line,
crashes will occur at runtime (often at process termination with a
``malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size`` and/or ``Aborted (core dumped)`` error message)
