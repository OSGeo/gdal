Summary
-------

LLM/AI are nowadays a reality, that starts reaching GDAL, and whether we like
it or not, introduces new challenges in our collaborative environment that need
to be addressed.

Details
-------

A new document, :ref:`ai_tool_policy`, is added to our documentation, linked from
the https://gdal.org/community.html,
https://gdal.org/development/dev_practices.html, pull request and issue templates.

As detailed at the bottom of that new page, this policy is directly derived from
the one adopted by the LLVM compiler project.

That document may evolve over time, as the best practices about that topic mature.
Substantial evolutions will be subject to approval of the revisions.
