U.S. Census of Agriculture County-Level Boundaries:
CoGenAll_GCS12 contains U.S. Census of Agriculture county-level boundaries for 
the continental U.S., Alaska, Puerto Rico and Hawaii.

U.S. Census of Agriculture State-Level Boundaries:
StGenAll_GCS12 contains U.S. state-level boundaries for the continental U.S., 
Alaska, Puerto Rico and Hawaii.

U.S. Census of Agriculture State-Level and County-Level Boundaries:
StCoGenAll_GCS12 contains U.S. state-level and county-level boundaries for the 
continental U.S., Alaska, Puerto Rico and Hawaii.

Purpose:
County-level and state-level boundary files are provided to be used with the 
statistical data in the 2012 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1.
The boundary files can be employed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) 
with the 2012 Agricultural Census Statistical data by using the Agricultural 
Census county codes to associate the county-level spatial entities with the 
county-level statistical data and the Agricultural Census state codes to 
associate the state-level spatial entities with the state-level statistical 
data. The statistical data can be obtained from the NASS census website 
(http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/). GIS software must be provided by the user 
in order to use the county-level and state-level boundary files.

Source:
The files were created from boundaries provided by the U.S. Census Bureau with 
a vintage year of 2012.  County and state areas are for land area (excludes 
water) and were provided by the U.S. Census Bureau with a vintage year of 2012.
Modifications were made to the County and State boundary files to show 
geographic areas for which the 2012 Agricultural Census Statistics are 
reported at the county- and state-levels. 

Format:
The boundary files are provided in an ESRI shapefile format. The shapefile 
format can be used with ESRI software(ArcView/ArcGIS) or if available, a 
translator can be used to import into other GIS software.
On Unix it may be necessary to use lower case for shapefile names.

Coordinate System: 
The datum is NAD 83 and the files are unprojected (GCS - Geographic Coordinate
System - latitude and longitude decimal degrees).
