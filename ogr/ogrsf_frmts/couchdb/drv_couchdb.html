<h1>CouchDB - CouchDB/GeoCouch</h1>

(GDAL/OGR >= 1.9.0)<p>

This driver can connect to the a CouchDB service, potentially enabled with the GeoCouch spatial extension.<p>
GDAL/OGR must be built with Curl support in order to the GFT driver to be compiled.<p>
The driver supports read and write operations.<p>

<h2>CouchDB vs OGR concepts</h2>

A CouchDB database is considered as a OGR layer. A CouchDB document is considered as a OGR feature.<p>

OGR can only handle CouchDB documents following the GeoJSON specification.<p>

<h2>Dataset name syntax</h2>

The syntax to open a CouchDB datasource is : <pre>couchdb:http://example.com[/layername]</pre> where
http://example.com points to the root of a CouchDB repository.

<h2>Authentication</h2>

Some operations, in particular write operations, require authentication. The authentication can
be passed with the <i>COUCHDB_USERPWD</i> environment variable set to user:password or directly in the URL.<p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>

The driver will forward any spatial filter set with SetSpatialFilter() to the server when GeoCouch extension
is available. It also makes the same for (very simple) attribute filters set with SetAttributeFilter(). When
server-side filtering fails, it will default back to client-side filtering.<p>

Note that the first time a request is issued, it might require write rights to create a new view.<p>

<h2>Paging</h2>

Features are retrieved from the server by chunks of 500 by default. This number can be altered with the COUCHDB_PAGE_SIZE
configuration option.<p>

<h2>Write support</h2>

Table creation and deletion is possible.<p>

Write support is only enabled when the datasource is opened in update mode.<p>

When inserting a new feature with CreateFeature(), and if the command is successfull, OGR will fetch the
returned _id and _rev and use them.<p>

<h2>Write support and OGR transactions</h2>

The CreateFeature()/SetFeature() operations are by default issued to the server synchronously with the OGR API call. This however
can cause performance penalties when issuing a lot of commands due to many client/server exchanges.<p>

It is possible to surround the CreateFeature()/SetFeature() operations between OGRLayer::StartTransaction() and OGRLayer::CommitTransaction().
The operations will be stored into memory and only executed at the time CommitTransaction() is called.<p>

<h2>Layer creation options</h2>

The following layer creation options are supported:
<ul>
<li><b>UPDATE_PERMISSIONS</b> = LOGGED_USER|ALL|ADMIN|function(...)|DEFAULT : Update permissions for the new layer.
<ul>
<li>If set to LOGGED_USER (the default), only logged users will be able to make changes in the layer.</li>
<li>If set to ALL, all users will be able to make changes in the layer.</li>
<li>If set to ADMIN, only administrators will be able to make changes in the layer.</li>
<li>If beginning with "function(", the value of the creation option will be used as the content of the <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/validation.html">validate_doc_update function</a>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, all users will be allowed to make changes in non-design documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<li>
Listing the tables of a CouchDB repository:
<pre>
ogrinfo -ro "couchdb:http://some_account.some_couchdb_server.com"
</pre>
<p>

<li>
Creating and populating a table from a shapefile:
<pre>
ogr2ogr -f couchdb "couchdb:http://some_account.some_couchdb_server.com" shapefile.shp
</pre>
<p>
