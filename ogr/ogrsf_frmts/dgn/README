		DGNLIB Source Distribution
		==========================

Current information on DGNLIB, including detailed API documentation
can be found at:

Building
--------

This is a preliminary source distribution, and I have not gone to any
pains to make it easy to configure and build.  To build please do the 
following:

1. Update cpl_config.h to represent your platform accurately.  Generally all
that matters is to #define WORDS_BIGENDIAN on big endian platforms.  The
rest can likely be ignored.<p>

2. Compile the sample program.  On unix this can be accomplished something
like:

  % gcc dgndump.c *.cpp -lm -o dgndump

It is left as an excercise to the reader to figure out how to handle it on
Windows.


Release Notes
=============

Release 1.4
-----------

 o Added experimental multi byte text support from Ason Kang
   (hiska@netian.com). 

Release 1.3
-----------

 o Added raw_data/raw_bytes members of DGNElemCore, and DGNSetOptions()
   to allow control of when raw element image is retained. 

 o Added -r flag to dgndump to dump raw contents of desired elements. 

 o Add CPL_CVSID() to simplify tracking of versions. 

 o Fixed bug with freeing element index in DGNClose().
