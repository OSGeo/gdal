<h1>ESRI ArcSDE</h1>

OGR optionally supports reading ESRI ArcSDE database instances.  ArcSDE is
a middleware spatial solution for storing spatial data in a variety of backend
relational databases.  The OGR ArcSDE driver depends on being built with the
ESRI provided ArcSDE client libraries. <p>

ArcSDE instances are accessed with a datasource name of the following
form.  The server, instance, username and password fields are required. The instance is the port number of the SDE server, which generally defaults to 5151.  If the layer parameter is specified then the SDE driver is able to skip reading the summary metadata for each layer; skipping this step can be a significant time savings. <p>

<pre>
  SDE:server,instance,database,username,password,layer
</pre>

The OGR ArcSDE driver does not support reading CAD data (treated as BLOB
attribute), annotation properties, measure values at vertices, or raster data.  
The ExecuteSQL() method does <b>not</b> get passed through to the underlying 
database.  For now it is interpreted by the limited OGR SQL handler.  
Spatial indexes are used to accelerate spatial queries.<p>

The driver has been tested with ArcSDE 9.x, and should work with newer
versions, as well as ArcSDE 8.2 or 8.3.  Both 2D and 3D geometries are
supported.  Curve geometries are approximated as line strings (actually 
still TODO).<p>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>OGR_SDE_GETLAYERTYPE</b>: This may be "TRUE" to determine the 
    geometry type from the database.  Otherwise, the SDE driver will always 
    return an Unknown geometry type.
</li>
</ul>
