<h1>PostgreSQL</h1>

This driver implements support for access to spatial tables in 
PostgreSQL extended with the 
<a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> spatial data support. 
Some support exists in the driver for use with PostgreSQL without PostGIS
but this has not been recently tested and is likely decayed.<p>

When opening a database, it's name should be specified in the form
"PG:dbname=<databasename>".  We use PQconnectdb() to make the connection, so 
any other options and defaults
that would apply to it, apply to the name here.  The PG: prefix is used
to mark the name as a postgres connection string.<p>

If the <i>geometry_columns</i> table exists, then all listed tables and
named views will be treated as OGR layers.  Otherwise all regular user tables
will be treated as layers.<p>

Regular (non-spatial) tables can be accessed, and will return features with
attributes, but not geometry.  If the table has a "wkb_geometry" field, it will
be treated as a spatial table.  The type of the field is inspected to 
determine how to read it.  It can be a PostGIS <b>geometry</b> field, which
is assumed to come back in OGC WKT, or type BYTEA or OID in which case it
is used as a source of OGC WKB geometry.<p>

If there is an "ogc_fid" field, it will be used to set the feature id of
the features, and not treated as a regular field. <p>

The PostgreSQL driver passes SQL statements directly to PostgreSQL rather
than evaluating them internally when using the ExecuteSQL() call on the
OGRDataSource, or the -sql command option to ogr2ogr.  Attribute query
expressions are also passed through to PostgreSQL.  The PostgreSQL
driver in OGR supports the OGRDataSource::StartTrasaction(), 
OGRDataSource::CommitTransaction() and OGRDataSource::RollbackTransaction()
calls in the normal SQL sense.<p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>

<li> The type recognition logic is currently somewhat impoverished.  
The types "INT*" and "NUMERIC(width,0)" are mapped to integer, the types
"FLOAT*" and "NUMERIC(width,precision>0)" are mapped to real, date, time, 
timestamp and datetime are handled as date types and all other
types are just treated as strings. <p>

<li> A sequence object called <tablename>_ogc_fid_seq is created for new
tables (layer), and must be dropped separately from the table when cleaning
up.<p>

<li> Sequential reading is done within a single transaction.  Any attempts
to write to a layer within a sequential read will likely result in a "BEGIN"
while already within a transaction type of error message.<p>

</ul>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The PostgreSQL driver does not support creation of new datasets (a database
within PostgreSQL), but it does allow creation of new layers within an
existing database.<P>

As mentioned above the type system is impoverished, and many OGR types
are not appropriate mapped into PostgreSQL.<p>

If the database has PostGIS types loaded (ie. the geometry type) newly
created layers will be created with the PostGIS Geometry type.  Otherwise
they will use OID.  

By default it is assumed that text being sent to Postgres is in the UTF-8
encoding.  This is fine for plain ASCII, but can result in errors for
extended characters (ASCII 155+ for instance).  Whle OGR provides no direct
control over this, you can set the PGCLIENTENCODING environment variable 
to indicate the format being provided.  For instance, if you text is 
LATIN1 you could set the environment variable to LATIN1 before using OGR
and input would be assumed to be LATIN1 instead of UTF-8. <p>

<h3>Dataset Creation Options</h3>

None<p>

<h3>Layer Creation Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>GEOM_TYPE</b>: The GEOM_TYPE layer creation option can be set to 
one of "Geometry", "BYTEA" or "OID" to force the type of geometry used for
a table. <p>
<li> <b>OVERWRITE</b>: This may be "YES" to force an existing layer of the
desired name to be destroyed before creating the requested layer.<p>
<li> <b>LAUNDER</b>: This may be "YES" to force new fields created on this
layer to have their field names "laundered" into a form more compatible with
PostgreSQL.  This converts to lower case and converts some special characters
like "-" and "#" to "_".  If "NO" exact names are preserved.  The default value is "YES".<p>
<li> <b>PRECISION</b>: This may be "YES" to force new fields created on this
layer to try and represent the width and precision information, if available
using NUMERIC(width,precision) or CHAR(width) types.  If "NO" then the types
FLOAT8, INTEGER and VARCHAR will be used instead.  The default is "YES".<p>
<li> <b>DIM={2,3}</b>: Control the dimension of the layer.  Defaults to 3. 
Important to set to 2 for 2D layers with PostGIS 1.0+ as it has constraints
on the geometry dimension during loading.<p>
<li> <b>GEOMETRY_NAME</b>: Set name of geometry column in new table.  If 
omitted it defaults to wkb_geometry.<p>
<li> <b>SCHEMA</b>: Set name of schema for new table. Sets search_path to schema,public.
More than one layers with the same name in different schemas ist not supported.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>PG_USE_COPY</b>: This may be "YES" for using COPY for inserting data to Postgresql.
COPY is less robust than INSERT, but signficantly faster.</li><p>
<li><b>PGSQL_OGR_FID</b>: Set name of primary key instead of 'ogc_fid'.</li><p>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

Simple translation of a shapefile into PostgreSQL.  The table 'abc' will
be created with the features from abc.shp and attributes from abc.dbf. 
The database instance (warmerda) must already exist, and the table abc must
not already exist. <p>

<pre>
% ogr2ogr -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda abc.shp
</pre>

<p>
This second example loads a political boundaries layer from VPF (via the
<a href="drv_ogdi.html">OGDI driver</a>), and renames the layer from the
cryptic OGDI layer name to something more sensible.  If an existing table
of the desired name exists it is overwritten.<p>

<pre>
% ogr2ogr -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda \
        gltp:/vrf/usr4/mpp1/v0eur/vmaplv0/eurnasia \
        -lco OVERWRITE=yes -nln polbndl_bnd 'polbndl@bnd(*)_line'
</pre>

<p>
In this example we merge tiger line data from two different directories of
tiger files into one table.  Note that the second invocation uses -append
and no OVERWRITE=yes. <p>

<pre>
% ogr2ogr -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda tiger_michigan \
     -lco OVERWRITE=yes CompleteChain
% ogr2ogr -update -append -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda tiger_ohio \
     CompleteChain
</pre>

<p>
This example shows using ogrinfo to evaluate an SQL query statement 
within PostgreSQL.  More sophisticated PostGIS specific queries may also be
used via the -sql commandline switch to ogrinfo.<p>

<pre>
ogrinfo -ro PG:dbname=warmerda -sql "SELECT pop_1994 from canada where province_name = 'Alberta'"
</pre>

<p>
This example shows using ogrinfo to list PostgreSQL/PostGIS layers on a different host.<p>

<pre>
ogrinfo -ro PG:'host=myserver.velocet.ca user=postgres dbname=warmerda'
</pre>
