<h1>MySQL</h1>

This driver implements read-only access for non-spatial data in 
<a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a> tables.  <p>

When opening a database, it's name should be specified in the form
"MYSQL:<dbname>[,options]" where the options can include comma seperated
items like "user=*userid*", "password=*password*", "host=*host*" and 
"port=*port*".<p>

As well, a "tablename=*table*;*table*..." option can be
added to restrict access to a specific list of tables in the database.  This
option is primarily useful when a database has alot of tables, and scanning
all their schemas would take a significant amount of time. <p>

Currently all regular user tables are assumed to be layers from an OGR
point of view, with the table names as the layer names.  Named views are
not currently support.<p>

If a single integer field is a primary key, it will be used as the FID 
otherwise the FID will be assigned sequentially, and fetches by FID will
be extremely slow. <p>
