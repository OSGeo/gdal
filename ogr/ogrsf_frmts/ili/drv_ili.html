<h1>INTERLIS</h1>

OGR has support for INTERLIS reading and writing.<br>
<a href="http://www.interlis.ch/">INTERLIS</a> is a standard which has been especially composed in order to fulfil the requirements of modelling and the integration of geodata into contemporary and future geographic information systems.

The current version is INTERLIS version 2. INTERLIS version 1 remains a Swiss standard.

With the usage of unified, documented geodata and the flexible exchange possibilities the following advantage may occur:
<ul>
<li>the standardized documentation 
<li>the compatible data exchange 
<li>the comprehensive integration of geodata e.g. from different data owners. 
<li>the quality proofing 
<li>the long term data storage 
<li>the contract-proof security and the availability of the software 
</ul>

<h2>Model</h2>

Data is read and written into transfer files which have different formats in INTERLIS 1 (.itf) and INTERLIS 2 (.xml).
For using the INTERLIS model (.ili) a Java interpreter is needed at runtime.
The model file can be added to the transfer file seperated by a comma.<p>
Sample usage:
<pre>
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" shp/ ili-bsp.itf,ili-bsp.ili

ogr2ogr -f "Interlis 1" shp/ili-bsp_ogr.itf,ili-bsp.ili ili-bsp.itf,ili-bsp.ili
</pre>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>
The INTERLIS 1 writer supports the follwing creation options:
<ul>
<li> <B>ARC_DEGREES=</B><i>value</i>: Arc interpolation angle in degrees (Default: 5).<p>
</ul>
