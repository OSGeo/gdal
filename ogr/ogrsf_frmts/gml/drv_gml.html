<h1>GML - Geography Markup Language</h1>

OGR has limited support for GML reading and writing. Update of existing
files is not supported.<p>

Supported GML flavors :
<table border>
<tr><th>OGR version</th><th>Read</th><th>Write</th></tr>
<tr><td>OGR &gt;= 1.8.0</td>
    <td>GML2 and GML3 that can<br>be translated into simple feature model</td>
    <td>GML 2.1.2 or GML 3 SF-0<br>(GML 3.1.1 Compliance level SF-0)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>OGR &lt; 1.8.0</td><td>GML2 and limited GML3</td><td>GML 2.1.2</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

<h2>Parsers</h2>

The reading part of the driver only
works if OGR is built with Xerces linked in. Starting with OGR 1.7.0, when
Xerces is unavailable, read support also works if OGR is built with Expat linked in.
XML validation is disabled by default.
GML writing is always supported, even without Xerces or Expat.<p>

Note: starting with OGR 1.9.0, if both Xerces and Expat are available at build time,
the GML driver will preferentially select at runtime the Expat parser for cases where it is possible
(GML file in a compatible encoding), and default back to Xerces parser in other cases.
However, the choice of the parser can be overriden by specifying the <b>GML_PARSER</b>
configuration option to <b>EXPAT</b> or <b>XERCES</b>.<p>

<h2>CRS support</h2>

Since OGR 1.8.0, the GML driver has coordinate system support. This is
only reported when all the geometries of a layer have a srsName attribute,
whose value is the same for all geometries. For srsName such as "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:",
for geographic coordinate systems (as returned by WFS 1.1.0 for example), the axis order
should be (latitude, longitude) as required by the standards, but this is
unusual and can cause issues with applications unaware of axis order. So
by default, the driver will swap the coordinates so that they are in the
(longitude, latitude) order and report a SRS without axis order specified.
It is possible to get the original (latitude, longitude) order and SRS with axis order
by setting the configuration option <b>GML_INVERT_AXIS_ORDER_IF_LAT_LONG</b>
to <b>NO</b>.<p>
There also situations where the srsName is of the form "EPSG:XXXX" (whereas
"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXX" would have been more explicit on the intent) and
the coordinates in the file are in (latitude, longitude) order. By default, OGR will
not consider the EPSG axis order and will report the coordinates in (latitude,longitude)
order. However, if you set the configuration option <b>GML_CONSIDER_EPSG_AS_URN</b> to
<b>YES</b>, the rules explained in the previous paragraph will be applied.<p>

<h2>Schema</h2>

In contrast to most GML readers, the OGR GML reader does not require
the presence of an XML Schema definition of the feature classes (file with .xsd
extension) to be able to read the GML file. If the .xsd file is absent or
OGR is not able to parse it, the driver attempts to automatically discover
the feature classes and their associated properties by scanning the file and
looking for "known" gml objects in the gml namespace to determine the organization.
While this approach is error prone, it has the advantage of working for GML files
even if the associated schema (.xsd) file has been lost.<p>

The first time a GML file is opened, if the associated .xsd is absent or could not been
parsed correctly, it is completely scanned in order to
determine the set of featuretypes, the attributes associated with each and
other dataset level information.  This information is stored in a .gfs file
with the same basename as the target gml file.  Subsequent accesses to the
same GML file will use the .gfs file to predefine dataset level information
accelerating access.  To a limited extent the .gfs file can be manually edited
to alter how the GML file will be parsed.  Be warned that the .gfs file will
be ignored if the associated .gml file has a newer timestamp.
<p>

When prescanning the GML file to determine the list of feature types, and
fields, the contents of fields are scanned to try and determine the type of the
field.  In some applications it is easier if all fields are just treated as
string fields.  This can be accomplished by setting the configuration option
<b>GML_FIELDTYPES</b> to the value <b>ALWAYS_STRING</b>.<p>

OGR 1.8.0 adds support for detecting feature attributes in nested GML elements
(non-flat attribute hierarchy) that can be found in some GML profiles
such as UK Ordnance Survey MasterMap. OGR 1.8.0 also brings support for reading
IntegerList, RealList and StringList field types when a GML element has several occurences.<p>

Since OGR 1.8.0, a specialized GML driver - the <a href="drv_nas.html">NAS</a> driver - is available to read
German AAA GML Exchange Format (NAS/ALKIS).<p>

Configuration options can be set via the CPLSetConfigOption() function or as
environment variables.<p>

<h2>Geometry reading</h2>

When reading a feature, the driver will by default only take into account the
last recognized GML geometry found (in case they are multiples) in the XML subtree describing the feature.<p>

Starting with OGR 1.8.0, the user can change the .gfs file to select the appropriate
geometry by specifying its path with the &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt; element. See the
description of the .gfs syntax below.<p>

<!-- Voluntary commented : a bit experimental for now and perhaps a better solution
     will emerge later -->
<!--
OGR 1.8.0 adds support to "merge" the multiple geometries found in a feature by
setting the configuration option <b>GML_FETCH_ALL_GEOMETRIES</b> to <b>YES</b>. The geometries
will be collected into a GeometryCollection (or Multipolygon if individual geometries
are polygons or multipolygons). This can be usefull when reading some GML application profiles.
If a &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt; element is specified in the .gfs, the fetching will be limited
to paths that match the value of &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt;.<p>
-->

OGR 1.8.0 adds support for more GML geometries including TopoCurve,
TopoSurface, MultiCurve. The TopoCurve type GML geometry can be interpreted as
either of two types of geometries.  The Edge elements in it contain curves and
their corresponding nodes.  By default only the curves, the main geometries,
are reported as OGRMultiLineString.  To retrieve the nodes, as OGRMultiPoint,
the configuration option <b>GML_GET_SECONDARY_GEOM</b> should be set to the
value <b>YES</b>.  When this is set only the secondary geometries are
reported.<p>

<h2>gml:xlink resolving</h2>

OGR 1.8.0 adds support for gml:xlink resolving.  When the resolver finds an
element containing the tag xlink:href, it tries to find the corresponding
element with the gml:id in the same gml file, other gml file in the file system
or on the web using cURL.  Set the configuration option
<b>GML_SKIP_RESOLVE_ELEMS</b> to <b>NONE</b> to enable resolution.<p>

By default the resolved file will be saved in the
same directory as the original file with the extension ".resolved.gml", if it
doesn't exist already.  This behaviour can be changed using the configuration
option <b>GML_SAVE_RESOLVED_TO</b>.  Set it to <b>SAME</b> to overwrite the
original file.  Set it to a <b>filename ending with .gml</b> to save it to that
location.  Any other values are ignored.  If the resolver cannot write to the
file for any reason, it will try to save it to a temperary file generated using
CPLGenerateTempFilename("ResolvedGML"); if it cannot, resolution fails.<p>

Note that the resolution algorithm is not optimised for large files.  For files
with more than a couple of thousand xlink:href tags, the process can go beyond
a few minutes.  A rough progress is displayed through CPLDebug() for every
256 links.  It can be seen by setting the environment variable CPL_DEBUG.
The resolution time can be reduced if you know any elements that
won't be needed.  Mention a comma seperated list of names of such elements with
the configuration option <b>GML_SKIP_RESOLVE_ELEMS</b>.  Set it to <b>ALL</b>
to skip resolving altogether (default action).  Set it to <b>NONE</b> to
resolve all the xlinks.<p>

<h2>Encoding issues</h2>

Expat library supports reading the following built-in encodings :
<ul>
<li>US-ASCII</li>
<li>UTF-8</li>
<li>UTF-16</li>
<li>ISO-8859-1</li>
</ul>

When used with Expat library, OGR 1.8.0 adds supports for Windows-1252 encoding (
for previous versions, altering the encoding mentionned in the XML header to
ISO-8859-1 might work in some cases).<p>

The content returned by OGR will be encoded in UTF-8, after the conversion from the
encoding mentionned in the file header is.<p>

If the GML file is not encoded in one of the previous encodings and the only parser available
is Expat, it will not be parsed by the GML driver. You may convert it into one of the supported
encodings with the <i>iconv</i> utility for example and change accordingly the <i>encoding</i>
parameter value in the XML header.<br>
<p>

When writing a GML file, the driver expects UTF-8 content to be passed in.<p>

<h2>Feature id (fid / gml:id)</h2>

Starting with OGR 1.8.0, the driver exposes the content of the gml:id attribute
as a string field called <i>gml_id</i>, when reading GML WFS documents. When creating
a GML3 document, if a field is called <i>gml_id</i>, its content will also be used to
write the content of the gml:id attribute of the created feature.<p>

Starting with OGR 1.9.0, the driver autodetects the presence of a fid (GML2)
(resp. gml:id (GML3)) attribute at the beginning of the file, and, if found,
exposes it by default as a <i>fid</i> (resp. <i>gml_id</i>) field. The autodetection
can be overriden by specifying the <b>GML_EXPOSE_FID</b> or <b>GML_EXPOSE_GML_ID</b> configuration
option to <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b>.<p>

Starting with OGR 1.9.0, when creating a GML2 document, if a field is called
<i>fid</i>, its content will also be used to write the content of the fid attribute of the
created feature.<p>

<h2>Performance issues with large multi-layer GML files.</h2>

There is only one GML parser per GML datasource shared among the various layers.
By default, the GML driver will restart reading from the beginning of the file, each time a layer
is accessed for the first time, which can lead to poor performance with large GML files.<p>

Starting with OGR 1.9.0, the <b>GML_READ_MODE</b> configuration option can be set to <b>SEQUENTIAL_LAYERS</b>
if all features belonging to the same layer are written sequentially in the file. The reader will then avoid
unnecessary resets when layers are read completely one after the other. To get the best performance,
the layers must be read in the order they appear in the file.<p>

If no .xsd and .gfs files are found, the parser will detect the layout of layers when
building the .gfs file. If the layers are found to be sequential, a <i>&lt;SequentialLayers&gt;true&lt;/SequentialLayers&gt;</i>
element will be written in the .gfs file, so that the GML_READ_MODE will be automatically
initialized to MONOBLOCK_LAYERS if not explicitely set by the user.<p>

Starting with OGR 1.9.0, the GML_READ_MODE configuration option can be set to INTERLEAVED_LAYERS to be able
to read a GML file whose features from different layers are interleaved. In the case, the semantics of the
GetNextFeature() will be slightly altered, in a way where a NULL return does not necessarily mean that
all features from the current layer have been read, but it could also mean that there is still a feature to read, but that
belongs to another layer. In that case, the file should be read with code similar to the following one :

<pre>
    int nLayerCount = poDS->GetLayerCount();
    int bFoundFeature;
    do
    {
        bFoundFeature = FALSE;
        for( int iLayer = 0; iLayer &lt; nLayerCount; iLayer++ )
        {
            OGRLayer   *poLayer = poDS->GetLayer(iLayer);
            OGRFeature *poFeature;
            while((poFeature = poLayer->GetNextFeature()) != NULL)
            {
                bFoundFeature = TRUE;
                poFeature->DumpReadable(stdout, NULL);
                OGRFeature::DestroyFeature(poFeature);
            }
        }
    } while (bInterleaved &amp;&amp; bFoundFeature);
</pre>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

On export all layers are written to a single GML file all in a single
feature collection.  Each layer's name is used as the element name for
objects from that layer.  Geometries are always written as the 
ogr:geometryProperty element on the feature.<p>

The GML writer supports the following dataset creation options:

<ul>
<li> <B>XSISCHEMAURI</B>: If provided, this URI will be inserted as the
schema location.  Note that the schema file isn't actually accessed by OGR, so
it is up to the user to ensure it will match the schema of the OGR produced 
GML data file.<p>

<li> <B>XSISCHEMA</B>: This can be EXTERNAL, INTERNAL or OFF and defaults to
EXTERNAL.  This writes a GML application schema file to a corresponding .xsd file
(with the same basename). If INTERNAL is used the schema is written within the GML
file, but this is experimental and almost certainly not valid XML.
OFF disables schema generation (and is implicit if XSISCHEMAURI is used).<p>

<li> <b>FORMAT</b>: (OGR &gt;= 1.8.0) This can be set to :
<ul>
<li><i>GML3</i> in order to write GML files that follow GML 3.1.1 SF-0 profile.</li>
<li><i>GML3Deegree</i> (OGR &gt;= 1.9.0) in order to produce a GML 3.1.1 .XSD schema,
with a few variations with respect to what is recommanded by GML3 SF-0 profile,
but that will be better accepted by some software (such as Deegree 3).</li>
<li><i>GML3.2</i>(OGR &gt;= 1.9.0) in order to write GML files that follow GML 3.2.1 SF-0 profile.</li>
</ul><br>
If not specified, GML2 will be used.<p>

<li> <b>GML3_LONGSRS</b>=YES/NO. (OGR &gt;= 1.8.0, only valid when FORMAT=GML3/GML3Degree/GML3.2) Default to YES. If YES, SRS with EPSG authority will
be written with the "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::" prefix.
In the case, if the SRS is a geographic SRS without explicit AXIS order, but that the same SRS authority code
imported with ImportFromEPSGA() should be treated as lat/long, then the function will take care of coordinate order swapping.
If set to NO, SRS with EPSG authority will be written with the "EPSG:" prefix, even if they are in lat/long order.<p>

<li> <b>SPACE_INDENTATION</b>=YES/NO. (OGR &gt;= 1.8.0) Default to YES. If YES, the output will be indented with spaces
for more readability, but at the expense of file size.<p>

</ul>

<h2>VSI Virtual File System API support</h2>

(Some features below might require OGR &gt;= 1.9.0)<p>

The driver supports reading and writing to files managed by VSI Virtual File System API, which include
"regular" files, as well as files in the /vsizip/ (read-write) , /vsigzip/ (read-write) , /vsicurl/ (read-only) domains.<p>

Writing to /dev/stdout or /vsistdout/ is also supported. Note that in that case, only the content of the GML file
will be written to the standard output (and not the .xsd). The &lt;boundedBy&gt; element will not be written. This is also
the case if writing in /vsigzip/<p>

<h2>Syntax of .gfs file by example</h2>

Let's consider the following test.gml file :

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;gml:FeatureCollection xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"&gt;
  &lt;gml:featureMember&gt;
    &lt;LAYER&gt;
      &lt;attrib1&gt;attrib1_value&lt;/attrib1&gt;
      &lt;attrib2container&gt;
        &lt;attrib2&gt;attrib2_value&lt;/attrib2&gt;
      &lt;/attrib2container&gt;
      &lt;location1container&gt;
        &lt;location1&gt;
            &lt;gml:Point&gt;&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;3,50&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;&lt;/gml:Point&gt;
        &lt;/location1&gt;
      &lt;/location1container&gt;
      &lt;location2&gt;
        &lt;gml:Point&gt;&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;2,49&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;&lt;/gml:Point&gt;
      &lt;/location2&gt;
    &lt;/LAYER&gt;
  &lt;/gml:featureMember&gt;
&lt;/gml:FeatureCollection&gt;
</pre>

and the following associated .gfs file.

<pre>
&lt;GMLFeatureClassList&gt;
  &lt;GMLFeatureClass&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;LAYER&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;ElementPath&gt;LAYER&lt;/ElementPath&gt;
    &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt;location1container|location1&lt;/GeometryElementPath&gt;
    &lt;PropertyDefn&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;attrib1&lt;/Name&gt;
      &lt;ElementPath&gt;attrib1&lt;/ElementPath&gt;
      &lt;Type&gt;String&lt;/Type&gt;
      &lt;Width&gt;13&lt;/Width&gt;
    &lt;/PropertyDefn&gt;
    &lt;PropertyDefn&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;attrib2&lt;/Name&gt;
      &lt;ElementPath&gt;attrib2container|attrib2&lt;/ElementPath&gt;
      &lt;Type&gt;String&lt;/Type&gt;
      &lt;Width&gt;13&lt;/Width&gt;
    &lt;/PropertyDefn&gt;
  &lt;/GMLFeatureClass&gt;
&lt;/GMLFeatureClassList&gt;
</pre>

Note the presence of the '|' character in the &lt;ElementPath&gt; and &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt elements to
specify the wished field/geometry element that is a nested XML element. Nested field elements are only supported from OGR 1.8.0, as well
 as specifying &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt; If GeometryElementPath is not specified, the
GML driver will use the last recognized geometry element.<p>

The output of <i>ogrinfo test.gml -ro -al</i> is:
<pre>
Layer name: LAYER
Geometry: Unknown (any)
Feature Count: 1
Extent: (3.000000, 50.000000) - (3.000000, 50.000000)
Layer SRS WKT:
(unknown)
Geometry Column = location1container|location1
attrib1: String (13.0)
attrib2: String (13.0)
OGRFeature(LAYER):0
  attrib1 (String) = attrib1_value
  attrib2 (String) = attrib2_value
  POINT (3 50)
</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a Oracle query to
GML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GML output.gml OCI:usr/pwd@db my_feature -where "id = 0"
</pre>

<P>
The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a PostGIS query to
GML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GML output.gml PG:'host=myserver dbname=warmerda' -sql "SELECT pop_1994 from canada where province_name = 'Alberta'"

</pre>
