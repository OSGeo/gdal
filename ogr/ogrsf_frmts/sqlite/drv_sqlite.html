<h1>SQLite RDBMS</h1>

<p>OGR optionally supports spatial and non-spatial tables stored in SQLite 3.x
database files.  SQLite is a "light weight" single file based RDBMS engine
with fairly complete SQL semantics and respectible performance.</p>

<p>The driver looks for a geometry_columns table layed out as defined
loosely according to OGC Simple Features standards, particularly as defined
in <A href="http://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/wiki/FDORfc16">FDO RFC 16</a>.  If
found it is used to map tables to layers.</P>

<p>If geometry_columns is not found, each table is treated as a layer.  Layers 
with a WKT_GEOMETRY field will be treated as spatial tables, and the 
WKT_GEOMETRY column will be read as Well Known Text geometry.</p>

<p>If geometry_columns is found, it will be used to lookup spatial reference
systems in the spatial_ref_sys table.</P>

<p>The SQLite database is essentially typeless, but the SQLite driver will
attempt to classify attributes field as text, integer or floating point
based on the contents of the first record in a table.  None of the list
attribute field types existing in SQLite.</p>

<p>SQLite databases often due not work well over NFS, or some other networked
file system protocols due to the poor support for locking.  It is safest
to operate only on SQLite files on a physical disk of the local system.</p>

<p>SQLite is an optionally compiled in driver.  It is not compiled in by default.</p>

<p>While the SQLite driver supports reading spatial data from records, there is
no support for spatial indexing, so spatial queries will tend to be slow.
Attributes queries may be fast, especially if indexes are built for 
appropriate attribute columns using the "CREATE INDEX <indexname> 
ON <tablename> ( <columnname> )" SQL command.</p>

<p>By default, SQL statements are passed directly to the SQLite database engine.
It's also possible to request the driver to handle SQL commands 
with <a href="/ogr/ogr_sql.html">OGR SQL</a> engine, 
by passing <strong>"OGRSQL"</strong> string to the ExecuteSQL() 
method, as name of the SQL dialect.</p>

<p>Starting with OGR 1.8.0, the OGR_SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS configuration option has been added.
When set to OFF, this issues a 'PRAGMA synchronous = OFF' command to the SQLite database.
This has the advantage of speeding-up some write operations (e.g. on EXT4 filesystems), but
at the expense of data safety w.r.t system/OS crashes. So use it carefully in
production environments and read the SQLite
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous">related documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>VSI Virtual File System API support</h2>

(Require OGR &gt;= 1.9.0 and SQLite &gt;= 3.6.0)<p>

The driver supports reading and writing to files managed by VSI Virtual File System API, which include
"regular" files, as well as files in the /vsimem/ (read-write), /vsizip/ (read-only), /vsigzip/ (read-only), /vsicurl/ (read-only) domains.<p>

Note: for regular files, the standard I/O operations provided by SQLite are used, in order to benefit
from its integrity guarantees.<p>

<h2>Using the SpatiaLite library (Spatial extension for SQLite)</h2>

(Starting with GDAL 1.7.0)<p>

The SQLite driver can read and write SpatiaLite databases. Creating or updating a spatialite database requires
explicit linking against SpatiaLite library (version >= 2.3.1). Explicit linking against SpatiaLite library also
provides access to functions provided by this library, such as spatial indexes, spatial functions, etc...<p>

A few examples :
<pre>
# Duplicate the sample database provided with SpatiaLite
ogr2ogr -f SQLite testspatialite.sqlite test-2.3.sqlite  -dsco SPATIALITE=YES

# Make a request with a spatial filter. Will work faster if spatial index has
# been created and explicit linking against SpatiaLite library.
ogrinfo testspatialite.sqlite Towns -spat 754000 4692000 770000 4924000
</pre>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

<p>The SQLite driver supports creating new SQLite database files, or adding
tables to existing ones.  Note that a new database file cannot be
created over an existing file.</p>

<h3>Database Creation Options</h3>

<ul>
	
<li> <b>METADATA=yes/no</b>: This can be used to avoid creating the 
geometry_columns and spatial_ref_sys tables in a new database.  By default
these metadata tables are created when a new database is created.

<li> <b>SPATIALITE=yes/no</b>: (Starting with GDAL 1.7.0) Create the SpatiaLite flavour of the metadata
tables, which are a bit differ from the metadata used by this OGR driver and
from OGC specifications. Implies <b>METADATA=yes</b>.<br>
Please note: (Starting with GDAL 1.9.0) OGR must be linked against <i>libspatialite</i> in order to support
insert/write on SpatiaLite; if not, <i>read-only</i> mode is enforced.<br>
Attempting to perform any insert/write on SpatiaLite skipping the appropriate library support simply produces broken (corrupted) DB-files.<br>
Important notice: when the underlaying <i>libspatialite</i> is v.2.3.1 (or any previous
version) any Geometry will be casted to 2D [XY], because earlier versions of this library
are simply able to support 2D [XY] dimensions. Version 2.4.0 (or any subsequent) is required in order to support 2.5D [XYZ].

<li> <b>INIT_WITH_EPSG=yes/no</b>: (Starting with GDAL 1.8.0) Insert the content of the EPSG CSV files
into the spatial_ref_sys table. Defaults to no</b>.<br>
Please note: if <b>SPATIALITE=yes</b> and the underlaying <i>libspatialite</i> is v.2.4 (or any subsequent 
version) <b>INIT_WITH_EPSG</b> is ignored anyway;
any recent version of this library will unconditionally load the EPSG 
dataset into the spatial_ref_sys table when creating a new DB (<i>self-initialization</i>).
</ul>

<h3>Layer Creation Options</h3>

<ul>

<li> <b>FORMAT=WKB/WKT/SPATIALITE</b>: Controls the format used for the
geometry column. By default WKB (Well Known Binary) is used.  This is
generally more space and processing efficient, but harder to inspect or use in
simple applications than WKT (Well Known Text). SpatiaLite extension uses its
own binary format to store geometries and you can choose it as well. It will
be selected automatically when SpatiaLite database is opened or created with
<b>SPATIALITE=yes</b> option. SPATIALITE value is available starting with GDAL 1.7.0 

<li> <b>LAUNDER=yes/no</b>: Controls whether layer and field names will be 
laundered for easier use in SQLite.  Laundered names will be convered to lower 
case and some special characters will be changed to underscores. 

<li> <b>SPATIAL_INDEX=yes/no</b>: (Starting with GDAL 1.7.0) If the database is
of the SpatiaLite flavour, and if OGR is linked against libspatialite, this option
can be used to control if a spatial index must be created. Default to yes.

<li> <b>COMPRESS_GEOM=yes/no</b>: (Starting with GDAL 1.9.0) If the format of the
geometry BLOB is of the SpatiaLite flavour, this option can be used to control
if the compressed format for geometries (LINESTRINGs, POLYGONs) must be used. This
format is understood by Spatialite v2.4 (or any subsequent version). Default to no.
Note: when updating an existing Spatialite DB, the COMPRESS_GEOM configuration option
can be set to produce similar results for appended/overwritten features.
