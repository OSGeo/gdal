<h1>AutoCAD DXF/DWG</h1>

Writing simple AutoCAD DXF and DWG files is supported.  Reading of DXF and
DWG files is currently not supported.  The ability to write DXF and DWG
is only available when OGR is linked against the DWGdirect library provided
by the <a href="http://www.opendesign.com/">Open Design Alliance</a>.  Note
that the DWGdirect library is not open source, though the license terms are
not terribly draconian.  Check the Open Design Alliance web site for details.
<p>

There are two distinct drivers, DXF for writing AutoCAD ASCII DXF files, 
and DWG for writing AutoCAD binary DWG files.  However, the data model
and behavior of both drivers is essentially identical.<p>

The DXF/DWG drivers currently operate in a highly simplified manner when
writing.  They discard all coordinate system information.  Attributes are
written as extended entity data (DXF type 1000) in the ACAD application.
Features are written out as one DXF/DWG entity per simple geometry object.
For complex geometry objects such as mutli-ring polygons, multipolygons,
and other geometry collections, a distinct entity is written out for each
simple geometry subcomponent.  Amoung other things, this means that the
association between the outer and inner rings of a polygon is lost, 
as well as the association of different geometries in a geometry collection.<p>

All entities are written out in "model space".  A layer is established for
each OGR layer written, and the entities attached to the appropriate layer.
