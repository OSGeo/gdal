	SDTS - Random Working Notes
	---------------------------

Assorted Complexities:

 o geometric features may have links to none, one or more attribute records.
   This can vary from feature to feature within a module (ie. LE01), and 
   it can't be established at the point where the module is opened what
   attribute modules are actually used.  In theory a list of all potentially
   applicable attribute modules could be collected from the catalog.  This
   is actually an issue in the basic DLG files. 

 o It is easy to associate features through the module/record id's, but 
   in order to quickly find an associated feature some sort of indexing
   pass would be needed on randomly searched modules (like attributes or
   lines).  For instance, this would be needed to compose whole polygons
   from lines efficiently, or to associate attribute records. 

 o Arcs (as opposed to lines) use different field name for the spatial 
   address.  (ie CADR for Arc). 

 o Rings, and Polygons just contain references to the lines composing them. 


Not doing:

 o Not reading offsets or vertical information from IREF module. No support
   for Z yet. 

 o Not really using the IREF HFMT value ... still just hardcoded to use
   BI32 for X and Y even though I carry the IREF object to the require
   code (ie. SDTSLineReader). 

 o SDTSLineReader only keeps that last attribute record link encountered.
   In practice there are often two, and in theory perhaps many more. 

 o sdts2shp assumes that the first two letters of a module name is 
   the object representation code (OBRP) which may be true for DLG or
   even TVP, but doesn't seem to be generally required. 

 o The code needs to be case insensitive about filenames. 



Report on Module Relationships
==============================

Lines
-----

Topological lines will have pointers to their start and end node, and
their left and right polygons.  Lines can also have pointers to one
or more attribute records.

eg. 

warmerda@gdal[300]% ~/shapelib-1.2.3/dbfdump -m dlg_shp/tr01le01.dbf | more

Record: 0
SDTSRecId:        1
LeftPoly: PC01:2      
RightPoly: PC01:4      
StartNode: NO01:13     
EndNode: NO01:14     
ARef_0: ARDF:1      
ARef_1: ARDM:1      
ARef_2: :-1         


SDTSRecId is the record id of this line feature in the LE01 module.  The
full name of this line is "LE01:1".

LeftPoly indicates that the left polygon is record 2 in module PC01 
(file TR01PC01.DDF).  RighPoly, StartNode, and EndNode work similarly. 

Lines can have a list of attribute records.  For now I translate them 
in no particular order, so this line is linked to attribute record 1 in 
module ARDF (TR01ARDF.DDR), and to attribute record 1 in module ARDM. 
The third entry is my representation of missing. 

I haven't seen any transfers with more than one line module, but in theory
there could be many (LE01, LE02, ...). 


Points
------

There are various kinds of points (notes, area markers, etc).  They can 
be related to an area, or an attribute record.  It does not appear that
end point nodes on lines have a reference back to the lines they start/end.

eg.

warmerda@gdal[306]% ~/shapelib-1.2.3/dbfdump -m dlg_shp/tr01na01.dbf | more

Record: 0
SDTSRecId:        2
Area: PC01:2      
ARef_0: :-1         
ARef_1: :-1         
ARef_2: :-1         

This particular point has a link to an area for which it is a label point.
This point has no attribute references of it's own (though the area may
very well have on the PC01:2 record). 


Areas
-----

Areas can have references to zero or more attribute records, but don't
normally have a reference to the lines or points that they relate to.  This
means that to build up a polygon like PC01:7, it is necessary to find all 
lines with that as a left or right polygon and reassemble ... a potentially 
expensive process. 

The sdts2shp program doesn't support areas yet, but using 8211dump we
can see it looks like this (it only has it's own identification information,
no references to other objects).  Note that some do have ATID (attribute
record references). 


--- record boundary ---

POLY : POLYGON
        MODN :  = PC01 (A)
        RCID :  = 7 (I)
        OBRP :  = PC (A)

...


Attributes
----------

Attribute records don't have any references to the objects they relate
to.  They consist of their own identity (record number) and a series of
user attributes.

Relationship Overview
---------------------

In order to read attributes related to a line or point quickly it will 
be necessary to pre-read and index all the attribute records.  

In order to assemble polygons efficiently it would be necessary to 
pre-read all the polygons, and all the lines.  For each polygon a list
of lines bordering it would have to be established, and an index to the
line records kept.
