<h1>Various Support GDAL Raster Formats</h1>


<h2><a name="AAIGrid">AAIGrid -- Arc/Info ASCII Grid</a></h2>

Supported for read and write access, including reading of an affine
georeferencing transform and some projections.  
This format is the ASCII interchange format for Arc/Info Grid, 
and takes the form of an ASCII file, plus sometimes an associated .prj file.
It is normally produced with the Arc/Info ASCIIGRID command.<p>

The projections support (read if a *.prj file is available) is quite
limited.  Additional sample .prj files may be sent to the maintainer,
<a href="mailto:warmerdam@pobox.com">warmerdam@pobox.com</a>.<p>

The NODATA value for the grid read is also preserved when available.
Grids are treated as signed 16bit integer unless the first scanline contains
decimal values in which case the image is treated as 32bit floating point.
<p>

The <a href="#AIG">AIG</a> driver is also available
for Arc/Info Binary Grid format.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aaigrid/aaigriddataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="AIG">AIG -- Arc/Info Binary Grid</a></h2>

Supported by GDAL for read access.  
This format is the internal binary format for Arc/Info Grid, 
and takes the form of a coverage level directory in an Arc/Info database. 
To open the coverage select the coverage directory, or an .adf file (such as
hdr.adf) from within it.<p>

Support includes reading of an affine 
georeferencing transform, some projections, and a color
table (.clr) if available.<p>

This driver is implemented based on a reverse engineering of the format.  See
the <a href="http://home.gdal.org/projects/aigrid/index.html">format 
description</a> for more details.<p>

The projections support (read if a prj.adf file is available) is quite
limited.  Additional sample prj.adf files may be sent to the maintainer,
<a href="mailto:warmerdam@pobox.com">warmerdam@pobox.com</a>.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aigrid/aigdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="BSB">BSB -- Maptech/NOAA BSB Nautical Chart Format</a></h2>

BSB Nautical Chart format is supported for read access, including reading 
the colour table and the reference points (as GCPs).  Note that the .BSB 
files cannot be selected directly.  Instead select the .KAP files.  Versions
1.1, 2.0 and 3.0 have been tested successfully.<p>

This driver should also support GEO/NOS format as supplied by Softchart.
These files normally have the extension .nos with associated .geo files
containing georeferencing ... the .geo files are currently ignored. <P>

This driver is based on work by Mike Higgins.  See the frmts/bsb/bsb_read.c
files for details on patents affecting BSB format.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/bsb/bsbdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="BT">BT -- VTP .bt Binary Terrain Format</a></h2>

The .bt format is used for elevation data in the VTP software.  The
driver includes support for reading and writing .bt 1.3 format including
support for Int16, Int32 and Float32 pixel data types.<p>

 The driver does
<b>not</b> support reading or writting gzipped (.bt.gz) .bt files even
though this is supported by the VTP software.  Please unpack the files
before using with GDAL using the "gzip -d file.bt.gz".<p>

Projections in external .prj files are read and written, and support for
most internally defined coordinate systems is also available.<p>

Read/write imagery access with the GDAL .bt driver is terribly slow due to
a very inefficient access strategy to this column oriented data.  This could
be corrected, but it would be a fair effort.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/btdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: The <a href="http://www.vterrain.org/Implementation/Formats/BT.html">
BT file format</a> is defined on the <a href="http://www.vterrain.org/">
VTP</a> web site.<p>

<h2><a name="CEOS">CEOS -- CEOS Image</a></h2>

This is a simple, read-only reader for ceos image files.  To use, select
the main imagery file.  This driver reads only the image data, and does
not capture any metadata, or georeferencing.<p>

This driver is known to work with CEOS data produced by Spot Image, but
will have problems with many other data sources.  In particular, it will
only work with eight bit unsigned data.<p>

See the separate <a href="#SAR_CEOS">SAR_CEOS</a> driver for access to 
SAR CEOS data products.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/ceos/ceosdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DODS"><a name="OPeNDAP">
DODS/OPeNDAP -- Read rasters from DODS/OPeNDAP servers</a></a></h2>

Support for read access to DODS/OPeNDAP servers. Pass the DODS/OPeNDAP URL to
the driver as you would when accessing a local file. The URL specifies the
remote server, data set and raster within the data set. In addition, you must
tell the driver which dimensions are to be interpreted as distinct bands as
well as which correspond to Latitude and Longitude. See the file README.DODS
for more detailed information.<p>

<h2><a name="DOQ1">DOQ1 -- First Generation USGS DOQ</a></h2>

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform, and capture of the projection string.   This format is the old,
unlabelled DOQ (Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/doq1dataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DOQ2">DOQ2 -- New Labelled USGS DOQ</a></h2>

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform, capture of the projection string and reading of other auxilary
fields as metadata.   This format is the new,
labelled DOQ (Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.<p>

This driver was implemented by Derrick J Brashear.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/doq2dataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: <a href="http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/doqstds.html">
USGS DOQ Standards</a><p>

<h2><a name="EHdr">EHdr -- ESRI .hdr Labelled</h2>

GDAL supports reading and writing the ESRI .hdr labelling format,
often referred to as ESRI BIL format.  Eight, sixteen
and thirty-two bit integer raster data types are supported as well as 32
bit floating point.  Coordinate systems (from a .prj file), and georeferencing
are supported.  Unrecognised options in the .hdr file are ignored.  To 
open a dataset select the file with the image file (often with the extension
.bil).  If present .clr color table files are read, but not written.<p>

This driver may be sufficient to read GTOPO30, SRTM30 + SRTM90 data and Geospot products.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/ehdrdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="ENVI">ENVI - ENVI .hdr Labelled Raster</h2>

GDAL supports some variations of raw raster files with associated ENVI
style .hdr files describing the format.  To select an existing ENVI raster
file select the binary file containing the data (as opposed to the .hdr 
file), and GDAL will find the .hdr file by replacing the dataset extension
with .hdr.<p>

GDAL should support reading bil, bip and bsq interleaved formats, and
most pixel types are supported, including 8, 16 and 32bit signed and unsigned
integers, 32bit and 64 bit floating point, and 32bit and 64bit complex floating
point.  There is limited support for recognising map_info keywords with the 
coordinate system and georeferencing.  In particular, UTM and State Plane 
should work.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

	<li> <b>INTERLEAVE=BSQ/BIP/BIL</b>: Force the generation specified
	type of interleaving. <b>BSQ</b> --- band sequental (default),
	<b>BIP</b> --- data interleaved by pixel,
	<b>BIL</b> --- data interleaved by line.<p>
	
	<li> <b>SUFFIX=REPLACE/ADD</b>: Force adding ".hdr" suffix to supplied
	filename, e.g. if user selects "file.bin" name for output dataset,
	"file.bin.hdr" header file will be created. By default header file
	suffix replaces the binary file suffix, e.g. for "file.bin" name
	"file.hdr" header file will be created.

</ul>


NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/envidataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="Envisat">Envisat -- Envisat Image Product</h2>

GDAL supports the Envisat product format for read access.  All sample
types are supported.  Files with two matching measurement datasets (MDS)
are represented as having two bands.  Currently all ASAR Level 1 and above
products, and some MERIS and AATSR products are supported.<p>

The control points of the GEOLOCATION GRID ADS dataset are read if available,
generally giving a good coverage of the dataset.  The GCPs are in WGS84.<p>

Virtually all key/value pairs from the MPH and SPH (primary and secondary
headers) are copied through as dataset level metadata. <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/envisat/envisatdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: <a href="http://envisat.esa.int/dataproducts/">
Envisat Data Products</a> at ESA.<p>

<h2><a name="FITS">FITS -- Flexible Image Transport System</h2>

<p>FITS is a format used mainly by astronomers, but it is a relatively
simple format that supports arbitrary image types and multi-spectral
images, and so has found its way into GDAL. FITS support is
implemented in terms of the standard <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">CFITSIO
library</a>, which you must have on your system in order for FITS
support to be enabled. Both reading and writing of FITS files is
supported. At the current time, no support for a georeferencing system
is implemented, but WCS (World Coordinate System) support is possible
in the future.

<p>Non-standard header keywords that are present in the FITS file will
be copied to the dataset's metadata when the file is opened, for
access via GDAL methods. Similarly, non-standard header keywords that
the user defines in the dataset's metadata will be written to the FITS
file when the GDAL handle is closed.

<p>Note to those familiar with the CFITSIO library: The automatic
rescaling of data values, triggered by the presence of the BSCALE and
BZERO header keywords in a FITS file, is disabled in GDAL. Those
header keywords are accessible and updatable via dataset metadata, in
the same was as any other header keywords, but they do not affect
reading/writing of data values from/to the file.

<p>NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/fits/fitsdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="GXF">GXF -- Grid eXchange File</a></h2>

This is a raster exchange format propagated by Geosoft, and made a standard
in the gravity/magnetics field.  The format is supported for read, and write
and includes support for georeferencing information, and projections. <p>

Details on the supporting code, and format can be found on the
<a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/gxf/index.html">GXF-3</a> page.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/gxf/gxfdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="IDA">IDA -- Image Display and Analysis</h2>

GDAL supports reading and writing IDA images with some limitations.  IDA 
images are the image format of WinDisp 4.  The files are always one band only
of 8bit data.  IDA files often have the extension .img though that is not
required.<p>

Projection and georeferencing information is read though some projections
(ie. Meteosat, and Hammer-Aitoff) are not supported.  When writing IDA files
the projection must have a false easting and false northing of zero. The 
support coordinate systems in IDA are Geographic, Lambert Conformal Conic,
Lambert Azimuth Equal Area, Albers Equal-Area Conic and Goodes Homolosine.<p>

IDA files typically contain values scaled to 8bit via a slope and offset.  
These are returned as the slope and offset values of the bands and they must
be used if the data is to be rescaled to original raw values for analysis. <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/idadataset.cpp</tt>. <p>

See Also: <A href="http://www.fao.org/giews/english/windisp/windisp.htm">WinDisp</a><p>

<h2><a name="ILWIS">ILWIS -- Raster Map</h2>

This driver implements reading and writing of ILWIS raster maps and map lists. Select the raster files with the.mpr (for raster map) or .mpl (for maplist) extensions
<p>
Features:
<ul>
<li>Support for Byte, Int16, Int32 and Float64 pixel data types.</li>
<li>Supports map lists with an associated set of ILWIS raster maps.</li>
<li>Read and write geo-reference (.grf). Support for geo-referencing transform is limited to north-oriented GeoRefCorner only. If possible the affine transform is computed from the corner coordinates.</li>
<li>Read and write coordinate files (.csy). Support is limited to: Projection type of Projection and Lat/Lon type that are defined in .csy file, the rest of pre-defined projection types are ignored.</li>
</ul>

Limitations:
<ul>
<li>Map lists with internal raster map storage (such as produced through Import General Raster) are not supported.</li>
<li>ILWIS domain (.dom) and representation (.rpr) files are currently ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="JDEM">JDEM -- Japanese DEM (.mem)</a></h2>

GDAL includes read support for Japanese DEM files, normally having the
extension .mem.  These files are a product of the Japanese Geographic Survey 
Institute.<p>

These files are represented as having one 32bit floating band with elevation
data.  The georeferencing of the files is returned as well as the coordinate
system (always lat/long on the Tokyo datum). <p>

There is no update or creation support for this format. <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/jdem/jdemdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: <a href="http://www.gsi.go.jp/ENGLISH/">Geographic Survey 
Institute (GSI) Web Site.</a><p>

<h2><a name="LAN">LAN -- Erdas 7.x .LAN and .GIS</a></h2>

GDAL supports reading Erdas 7.x .LAN and .GIS raster files.  Currently 
4bit, 8bit and 16bit pixel data types are supported.  <p>

GDAL does read the map extents (geotransform) from LAN/GIS files, and 
attempts to read the coordinate system informaton.  However, this format
of file does not include complete coordinate system information, so for
state plane and UTM coordinate systems a LOCAL_CS definition is returned
with valid linear units but no other meaningful information.<p>

The .TRL, .PRO and worldfiles are ignored at this time.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/landataset.cpp</tt><p>

Development of this driver was financially supported by Kevin Flanders of
(<a href="http://www.peoplegis.com">PeopleGIS</a>). <p>

<h2><a name="MFF">MFF -- Vexcel MFF Raster</a></h2>

GDAL includes read, update, and creation support for Vexcel's
MFF raster format.  MFF dataset consist of a header file (typically with
the extension .hdr) and a set of data files with extensions like .x00, .b00
and so on.   To open a dataset select the .hdr file.<p>

Reading lat/long GCPs (TOP_LEFT_CORNER, ...) is supported but there is no
support for reading affine georeferencing or projection information.<p>

Unrecognised keywords from the .hdr file are preserved as metadata. <p>

All data types with GDAL equivelents are supported, including 8, 16, 32 and
64 bit data precisions in integer, real and complex data types.  In addition
tile organized files (as produced by the Vexcel SAR Processor - APP) are
supported for reading. <p>

On creation (with a format code of MFF) a simple, ungeoreferenced raster
file is created.<p>

MFF files are not normally portable between systems with different byte orders.
However GDAL honours the new BYTE_ORDER keyword which can take a value of
LSB (Integer -- little endian), and MSB (Motorola -- big endian).  This may
be manually added to the .hdr file if required.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/mffdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>


<h2><a name="NDF">NDF -- NLAPS Data Format</a></h2>

GDAL has limited support for reading NLAPS Data Format files.  This is a
format primarily used by the Eros Data Center for distribution of Landsat 
data.  NDF datasets consist of a header file (often with the extension .H1)
and one or more associated raw data files (often .I1, .I2, ...).  To open
a dataset select the header file, often with the extension .H1, .H2 or
.HD. <p>

The NDF driver only supports 8bit data.  The only supported projection is
UTM.  NDF version 1 (NDF_VERSION=0.00) and NDF version 2 are both supported.
<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/ndfdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/documents/NLAPSII.pdf">NLAPS
Data Format Specification</a>.<p>					

<h2><a name="netCDF">netCDF -- Network Common Data Format</a></h2>

GDAL has limited support for reading and writing netCDF <i>grid</i> files.
NetCDF files that are not recognised as grids (they lack variables called
dimension, and z) will be silently ignored by this driver.  This driver is
primarily intended to provide a mechanism for grid interchange with the 
<a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT</a> package; however, I am 
interested in correcting deficiencies in interchange with other netCDF 
using packages as well. <p>

The units information in the netCDF file will be ignored, but x_range, and
y_range information will be read to get georeferenced extents of the raster.
All netCDF data types should be supported for reading.

Newly created files (with a type of <tt>netCDF</tt>) will always have
units of "meters" for x, y and z but the x_range, y_range and z_range should 
be correct.  Note that netCDF does not have an unsigned byte data type, so 
8bit rasters will generally need to be converted to Int16 for export to 
GMT.<p>

NetCDF support in GDAL is optional, and not compiled in by default.  <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/netcdf/netcdfdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">Unidata NetCDF Page</a><p>

<h2><a name="PAux">PAux -- PCI .aux Labelled Raw Format</a></h2>

GDAL includes a partial implementation of the PCI .aux labelled raw raster 
file for read, write and creation.  To open a PCI labelled file, select the
raw data file itself.  The .aux file (which must have a common base name) will
be checked for automatically. <p>

The format type for creating new files is <tt>PAux</tt>.  All PCI data types
(8U, 16U, 16S, and 32R) are supported.  Currently georeferencing, projections, 
and other metadata is ignored.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/pauxdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

Description</a><p>

<h2><a name="PCRaster">PCRaster raster file format</a></h2>
<p>GDAL includes support for reading and writing PCRaster raster files. PCRaster is a dynamic modelling system for distributed simulation models. The main applications of PCRaster are found in environmental modelling: geography, hydrology, ecology to name a few. Examples include rainfall-runoff models, vegetation competition models and slope stability models.</p>

<p>The driver reads all types of PCRaster maps: booleans, nominal, ordinals, scalar, directional and ldd. The same cell representation used to store values in the file is used to store the values in memory.</p>

<p>The driver detects whether the source of the GDAL raster is a PCRaster file. When such a raster is written to a file the value scale of the original raster will be used. The driver <b>always</b> writes values using UINT1, INT4 or REAL4 cell representations, depending on the value scale:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Value scale</th>
      <th>Cell representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>VS_BOOLEAN</td>
      <td>CR_UINT1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VS_NOMINAL</td>
      <td>CR_INT4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VS_ORDINAL</td>
      <td>CR_INT4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VS_SCALAR</td>
      <td>CR_REAL4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VS_DIRECTION</td>
      <td>CR_REAL4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VS_LDD</td>
      <td>CR_UINT1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For rasters from other sources than a PCRaster raster file a value scale and cell representation is determined according to the folowing rules:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Source type</th>
      <th>Target value scale</th>
      <th>Target cell representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>GDT_Byte</td>
      <td>VS_BOOLEAN</td>
      <td>CR_UINT1</td>
    </tr>
    <!--
    <tr>
      <td>GDT_UInt16</td>
      <td>VS_NOMINAL</td>
      <td>CR_UINT1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GDT_UInt32</td>
      <td>VS_NOMINAL</td>
      <td>CR_UINT1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GDT_Int16</td>
      <td>VS_NOMINAL</td>
      <td>CR_INT4</td>
    </tr>
    -->

    <tr>
      <td>GDT_Int32</td>
      <td>VS_NOMINAL</td>
      <td>CR_INT4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GDT_Float32</td>
      <td>VS_SCALAR</td>
      <td>CR_REAL4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GDT_Float64</td>
      <td>VS_SCALAR</td>
      <td>CR_REAL4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The driver can convert values from one supported cell representation to another. It cannot convert to unsupported cell representations. For example, it is not possible to write a PCRaster raster file from values which are used as CR_INT2 (GDT_Int16).

<p>NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/pcraster/pcrasterdataset.cpp</tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="PNG">PNG -- Portable Network Graphics</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading, and creating .png files.  Greyscale, 
pseudo-colored, Paletted, RGB and RGBA PNG files are supported as well as 
precisions of eight and sixteen bits per sample.<p>

PNG files are linearly compressed, so random reading of large PNG files can
be very inefficient (resulting in many restarts of decompression from the
start of the file).<p>

Text chunks are translated into metadata, typically with multiple lines per
item.  <a href="#WLD">World files</a> with the extensions of .wld, .tfw or
.tifw will be read.  Single transparency values in greyscale files will be
recognised as a nodata value in GDAL.  Transparent index in paletted images
are preserved when the color table is read. <p>

PNG files can be created with a type of PNG, using the CreateCopy() method, 
requiring a prototype to read from.  Writing includes support for the
various image types, and will preserve transparency/nodata values.  
Georeferencing .wld files are written if option WORLFFILE setted.  All
pixel types other than 16bit unsigned will be written as eight bit.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>WORLDFILE=YES</b>: Force the generation of an associated ESRI world
file (.wld). See <a href="#WLD">World File</a> section for details.<p>
</ul>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/png/pngdataset.cpp</tt>.<p> 

PNG support is implemented based on the libpng reference library.  
More information is available at <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png">
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png</a>.<p>

<h2><a name="PNM">PNM -- Netpbm (.pgm, .ppm)</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading, and creating .pgm (greyscale), and
.ppm (RGB color) files compatible with the Netpbm tools.  Only the binary
(raw) formats are supported.<p>

Netpbm files can be created with a type of PNM.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>MAXVAL=n</b>: Force setting the maximum color value to <B>n</B>
in the output PNM file. May be useful if you plannig use the output files with
software which is not liberal to this value.<p>
</ul>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/pnmdataset.cpp</tt>. 

<h2><a name="SAR_CEOS">SAR_CEOS -- CEOS SAR Image</a></h2>

This is a read-only reader for CEOS SAR image files.  To use, select
the main imagery file.<p>

This driver works with most Radarsat and ERS data
products, including single look complex products; however, it is unlikely
to work for non-Radar CEOS products.  The simpler <a href="#CEOS">CEOS</a>
driver is often appropriate for these.<p>

This driver will attempt to read 15 lat/long GCPS by sampling the per-scanline
CEOS superstructure information.  It also captures various pieces of metadata
from various header files, including:<p>

<pre>
  CEOS_LOGICAL_VOLUME_ID=EERS-1-SAR-MLD  
  CEOS_PROCESSING_FACILITY=APP         
  CEOS_PROCESSING_AGENCY=CCRS    
  CEOS_PROCESSING_COUNTRY=CANADA      
  CEOS_SOFTWARE_ID=APP 1.62    
  CEOS_ACQUISITION_TIME=19911029162818919               
  CEOS_SENSOR_CLOCK_ANGLE=  90.000
  CEOS_ELLIPSOID=IUGG_75         
  CEOS_SEMI_MAJOR=    6378.1400000
  CEOS_SEMI_MINOR=    6356.7550000
</pre>

The SAR_CEOS driver also includes some support for SIR-C and PALSAR 
polarimetric data.  The SIR-C format contains an image in compressed
scattering matrix form, described 
<a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/software/dcomp/dcomp.html">here</a>.  
GDAL decompresses the data as it is read in.  The PALSAR format
contains bands that correspond almost exactly to elements of the 3x3
Hermitian covariance matrix-
see the <a href="http://www.ersdac.or.jp/palsar/palsar_E.html">
ERSDAC-VX-CEOS-004A.pdf</a> document for a complete description (pixel 
storage is described on page 193). GDAL converts these to complex floating
point covariance matrix bands as they are read in.  The convention used
to represent the covariance matrix in terms of the scattering matrix
elements HH, HV (=VH), and VV is indicated below. Note that the 
non-diagonal elements of the matrix are complex values, while the diagonal
values are real (though represented as complex bands).<p> 

<ul>
<li> Band 1: Covariance_11 (Float32) = HH*conj(HH)
<li> Band 2: Covariance_12 (CFloat32) = sqrt(2)*HH*conj(HV)
<li> Band 3: Covariance_13 (CFloat32) = HH*conj(VV)
<li> Band 4: Covariance_22 (Float32) = 2*HV*conj(HV)
<li> Band 5: Covariance_23 (CFloat32) = sqrt(2)*HV*conj(VV)
<li> Band 6: Covariance_33 (Float32) = VV*conj(VV)
</ul>


The identities of the bands are also reflected in the metadata.  <p>

<h2><a name="SDTS">SDTS -- USGS SDTS DEM</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading USGS SDTS formatted DEMs.  USGS DEMs are
always returned with a data type of signed sixteen bit integer, or 32bit float.
Projection and georeferencing information is also returned.<p>

SDTS datasets consist of a number of files.  Each DEM should have one file
with a name like XXXCATD.DDF.  This should be selected to open
the dataset.<p>

The elevation units of DEMs may be feet or meters.  The GetType() method on a 
band will attempt to return if the units are Feet ("ft") or Meters ("m").

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/sdts/sdtsdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="SGI">SGI - SGI Image Format</a></h2>

The SGI driver currently supports the reading of SGI Image files.<p>

The driver currently supports 1, 2, 3, and 4 band images. The driver 
currently supports "8 bit per channel value" images. The driver supports 
both uncompressed and run-length encoded (RLE) images.<p>

The GDAL SGI Driver was based on Paul Bourke's SGI image read code.<p>

The driver does not currently have any image creation capabilities.<p>

<h2><a name="WLD">WLD -- ESRI World File</a></h2>

A world file file is a plain ASCII text file consisting of six values separated
by newlines.  The format is: <br>

<pre>
 pixel X size
 rotation about the Y axis (usually 0.0)
 rotation about the X axis (usually 0.0)
 negative pixel Y size
 X coordinate of upper left pixel
 Y coordinate of upper left pixel
</pre>

For example: <br>

<pre>
60.0000000000
0.0000000000
0.0000000000
-60.0000000000
440750.0000000000
3751290.0000000000
</pre>

You can construct that file simply by using your favorite text editor.<p>

World file usually has suffix .wld, but sometimes it may has .tfw, tifw, .jgw
or other suffixes depending on the image file it comes with.<p>

<h2><a name="XPM">XPM - X11 Pixmap</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading and writing XPM (X11 Pixmap Format) 
image files.  These are colormapped one band images primarily used for 
simple graphics purposes in X11 applications.  It has been incorporated in
GDAL primarily to ease translation of GDAL images into a form useable with
the GTK toolkit.<p>

The XPM support does not support georeferecing (not available from XPM files)
nor does it support XPM files with more than one character per pixel.  New
XPM files must be colormapped or greyscale, and colortables will be reduced
to about 70 colors automatically.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/xpm/xpmdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>
