<h1>HFA -- Erdas Imagine .img</h1>

GDAL supports Erdas Imagine .img format for read access and write.  The current
implementation ignores pyramid levels, and metadata but does capture 
palettes, and georeferencing.  It supports the erdas band types 
u8, s8, u16, s16, u32, s32, f32, f64, c64 and c128.<p>

Compress and missing tiles in Erdas files should be handled properly on read.
<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

Erdas Imagine files can be created with any GDAL defined band type, including
the complex types.  Created files may have any number of bands.  Pseudo-Color
tables will be written if using the GDALDriver::CreateCopy() methodology.
Most projections should be supported though translation of unusual datums
(other than WGS84, WGS72, NAD83, and NAD27) may be problematic. <p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> There are no creation options for Erdas Imagine files at this time.

</ul>

Erdas Imagine supports external creation of overviews (with gdaladdo for 
instance).<p>
