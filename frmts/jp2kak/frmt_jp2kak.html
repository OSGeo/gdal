<h1>JP2KAK -- JPEG-2000 (based on Kakadu)</h1>

Most forms of JPEG2000 JP2 and JPC compressed images (ISO/IEC 15444-1) can be 
read with GDAL using a driver based on the Kakadu library.  As well, new images
can be written.  Existing images cannot be updated in place.<p>

The JPEG2000 file format supports lossy and lossless compression of 
8bit and 16bit images with 1 or more bands (components).  Via the 
<a href="http://www.mappingscience.com/msi.html">GeoJP2 (tm)</a> mechanism,
GeoTIFF style coordinate system and georeferencing information can be embedded
within the JP2 file.  JPEG2000 files use a substantially different format and
compression mechanism than the traditional JPEG compression and JPEG JFIF 
format.  They are distinct compression mechanisms produced by the same
group.  JPEG2000 is based on wavelet compression.<p>

The JPEG2000 driver documented on this page (the JP2KAK driver) is implemented
on top of the commercial <a href="http://www.kakadusoftware.com/">Kakadu</a>
library.  This is a high quality and high performance JPEG2000 library in wide
used in the geospatial and general imaging community.  However, it is not free,
and so normally builds of GDAL from source will not include support for this
driver unless the builder purchases a license for the library and configures
accordingly.  GDAL includes <a href="frmt_jpeg2000.html">another JPEG2000 driver</a>
based on the free JasPer library.<p>

When reading images this driver will represent the bands as being 
Byte (8bit unsigned), 16 bit signed or 16 bit unsigned.  Georeferencing
and coordinate system information will be available if the file is a 
GeoJP2 (tm) file.  Files color encoded in YCbCr color space will be 
automatically translated to RGB.  Paletted images are also supported.<P>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

JPEG2000 files can only be created using the CreateCopy mechanism to
copy from an existing dataset.<p>

JPEG2000 overviews are maintained as part of the mathematical description of
the image.  Overviews cannot be built as a separate process, but on read the
image will generally be represented as having overview levels at various 
power of two factors.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>QUALITY=n</b>: Set the compressed size ratio as a percentage
of the size of the uncompressed image.  The default is 20 indicating that
the resulting image should be 20% of the size of the uncompressed image. 
A value of 100 will result in use of the lossless compression algorithm . 
Actual final image size may not exactly match that requested depending on 
various factors.<P>

<li> <b>BLOCKXSIZE=n</b>: Set the tile width to use.  By default the image 
is one big tile unless it is larger than two gigapixels in which case it is 
split up.
<p>

<li> <b>BLOCKYSIZE=n</b>: Set the tile height to use.  By default the image 
is one big tile unless it is larger than two gigapixels in which case it is 
split up.
<p>

<li> <b>LAYERS=n</b>: Control the number of layers produced.  These are 
sort of like resolution layers, but not exactly.  The default value is
12 and this works well in most situations.<p>

<li> <b>ROI=xoff,yoff,xsize,ysize</b>: Selects a region to be a region of
interest to process with higher data quality.  The various "R" flags below may
be used to control the amount better.  For example the settings 
"ROI=0,0,100,100", "Rweight=7" would encode the top left 100x100 area of
the image with considerable higher quality compared to the rest of the image.
<p>

</ul>

The following creation options are tightly tied to the Kakadu library, and
are considered to be for advanced use only.  Consult Kakadu documentation
to better understand their meaning.<p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Corder</b>: Defaults to "PRCL". 
<li> <b>Cprecincts</b>: Defaults to "{512,512},{256,512},{128,512},{64,512},{32,512},{16,512},{8,512},{4,512},{2,512}".
<li> <b>ORGgen_plt</b>: Defaults to "yes". 
<li> <b>Cmodes</b>: Kakadu library default used.
<li> <b>Clevels</b>: Kakadu library default used.
<li> <b>Rshift</b>: Kakadu library default used.
<li> <b>Rlevels</b>: Kakadu library default used.
<li> <b>Rweight</b>: Kakadu library default used.
</ul>
