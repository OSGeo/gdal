# GDAL/OGR 3.9.1 Release Notes

GDAL 3.9.1 is a bugfix release.

## Build

* PDF: fix build with PoDoFo >= 0.10 with C++20 compilation (#9875)
* PDF: fix build against PoDoFo with MSYS2 UCRT64 and CLANG64 (#9976)
* Fix compiler errors in C++20 and C++23 modes
* Fix compiler warnings with gcc 14
* CMake: add infrastructure so we can build plugins that can be loaded against
  a libgdal that has been without any support for them.
  Note: this is an ABI break for in-tree drivers, with deferred loading capability, when built as plugin. That is such a driver built against
  GDAL 3.9.0 won't be able to be loaded by GDAL 3.9.1.

# GDAL/OGR 3.6.1 Release Notes

GDAL 3.6.1 is a bugfix release. It officially retracts GDAL 3.6.0 which
could cause corruption of the spatial index of GeoPackage files it created
(in tables with 100 000 features or more):
cf https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/51188 and
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/6911. GDAL 3.6.1 fixes that issue. Setting
OGR_GPKG_ALLOW_THREADED_RTREE=NO environment variable (at generation time)
also works around the issue with GDAL 3.6.0. Users who have generated corrupted
GeoPackage files with 3.6.0 can regnerate them with 3.6.1 with, for example,
"ogr2ogr out_ok.gpkg in_corrupted.gpkg" (assuming a GeoPackage file with vector
content only)

* Add build support for libhdf5 1.13.2 and 1.13.3 (#6657)

  https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/33856#issue-1446090634)
* configure.cmake: fix wrong detection of pread64 for iOS
* FindSQLite3.cmake: add logic to invalidate SQLite3_HAS_ variables if

GDAL 3.6.1 is a bugfix release. It officially retracts GDAL 3.6.0 which
could cause corruption of the spatial index of GeoPackage files it created
(in tables with 100 000 features or more):
cf https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/51188 and
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/6911. GDAL 3.6.1 fixes that issue. Setting
OGR_GPKG_ALLOW_THREADED_RTREE=NO environment variable (at generation time)
also works around the issue with GDAL 3.6.0. Users who have generated corrupted
GeoPackage files with 3.6.0 can regnerate them with 3.6.1 with, for example,
"ogr2ogr out_ok.gpkg in_corrupted.gpkg" (assuming a GeoPackage file with vector
content only)
