OGRGeometry:
 - WKT (and GML) encoding now attempts to preserve pretty much full double
   precision. 
 - geometries are now "coordinate dimension preserving" rather than dynamically
   figuring out dimension depending on whether Z is set.  So a geometry can
   now be 3D even if all z values are zero.
