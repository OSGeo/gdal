GDAL 1.1.6 - Overview of Changes
--------------------------------

 o Implemented USGS DEM reading.

 o Implemented BSB Format (Nautical Chart Format) read support.

 o Preliminary implementation of Virtual Datasets (gdal/frmts/vrt). 

 o Preliminary support for writing DTED files. 

 o Some raw formats (ie. PAux, HKV) support files larger than 2GB.

 o Add the AddBand() method on GDALDataset.

 o PAux: Added color table read support. 

 o Various fixes to OGDI driver.

 o Stripped out the GDALProjDef related capabilities.  Superceeded by
   OGRSpatialReference, and OGRCoordinateTransformation functionality.

 o Improved CEOS support, notable for ESA LANDSAT files, D-PAF ERS-1 and
   Telaviv ERS data. 

 o geotiff: upgraded libtiff support to approximately libtiff 3.5.7.



OGR 1.1.6 - Overview of Changes
-------------------------------

 o Fixed OGDI driver so that gltp urls with drive letters work properly on 
   windows.

 o Many improvements to OLE DB provider during the process of making it 
   compatible with the MapGuide (SDP) client.  These include implementing
   restrictions for schema rowsets, treating missing information like WKT
   coordinate systems as NULL fields, and setting ISLONG on geometry fields.
   Also made thread safe. 

 o DGN: Thread SHAPE elements as polygons.  Set style information for text.
   Added 3D support for most elements. 

 o Fixed bugs in WKT format for some OGR geometry types (ie. multipoint).

 o Added support for morphing to/from ESRI WKT format for OGRSpatialReference.

 o NTF: Don't try to cache all the records from multiple files at once.

 o Added experimental XML SRS support ... not the final schema.  Added
   supporting "minixml" support to CPL.			

 o PostGIS: Upgraded to PostGIS 0.6.  Added "soft transaction" semantics.  
   Many create feature calls can now be part of one transaction.  Transactions
   are now a general OGR concept although only implemented for PostGIS. 

 o Added transform() and transformTo() methods for reprojecting geometries and
   added user options for this in ogr2ogr.
