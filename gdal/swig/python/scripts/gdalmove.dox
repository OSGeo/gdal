Transform georeferencing of raster file in place

\section gdalmove_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\verbatim
gdalmove.py [-s_srs <srs_defn>] -t_srs <srs_defn>
            [-et <max_pixel_err>] target_file
\endverbatim

\section gdal_move_description DESCRIPTION

The gdalmove.py script transforms the bounds of a raster file from
one coordinate system to another, and then updates the coordinate
system and geotransform of the file.  This is done without altering
pixel values at all.  It is loosely similar to using gdalwarp to transform
an image but avoiding the resampling step in order to avoid image damage.
It is generally only suitable for transformations that are effectively linear
in the area of the file.

If no error threshold value (-et) is provided then the file is not actually
updated, but the errors that would be incurred are reported.  If -et is
provided then the file is only modify if the apparent error being introduced
is less than the indicate threshold (in pixels).

Currently the transformed geotransform is computed based on the
transformation of the top left, top right, and bottom left corners.  A reduced
overall error could be produced using a least squares fit of at least all
four corner points.

<dl>

<dt> <b>-s_srs</b> <i>srs_defn</i>:</dt><dd>

Override the coordinate system of the file with the indicated coordinate
system definition.  Optional.  If not provided the source coordinate
system is read from the source file.

<dt> <b>-t_srs</b> <i>srs_defn</i>:</dt><dd>

Defines the target coordinate system.  This coordinate system will be
written to the file after an update.

<dt> <b>-et</b> <i>max_pixel_err</i>:</dt><dd>

The error threshold (in pixels) beyond which the file will not be updated.
If not provided no update will be applied to the file, but errors will be
reported.

<dt> <i>target_file</i></dt><dd> The file to be operated on.  To update this
must be a file format that supports in place updates of the geotransform
and SRS.</dd>
