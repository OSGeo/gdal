#  Name:     gdalcopyproj.py
#  Project:  GDAL Python Interface
#  Purpose:  Duplicate the geotransform and projection metadata from
#	     one raster dataset to another, which can be useful after
#	     performing image manipulations with other software that
#	     ignores or discards georeferencing metadata.
