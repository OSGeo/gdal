%feature("docstring")  AssignSpatialReference "void
OGR_G_AssignSpatialReference(OGRGeometryH hGeom, OGRSpatialReferenceH
hSRS)

Assign spatial reference to this object.

Any existing spatial reference is replaced, but under no circumstances
does this result in the object being reprojected. It is just changing
the interpretation of the existing geometry. Note that assigning a
spatial reference increments the reference count on the
OGRSpatialReference, but does not copy it.

This is similar to the SFCOM IGeometry::put_SpatialReference() method.

This function is the same as the CPP method
OGRGeometry::assignSpatialReference.

Parameters:
-----------

hGeom:  handle on the geometry to apply the new spatial reference
system.

%feature("docstring")  TransformTo "OGRErr
OGR_G_TransformTo(OGRGeometryH hGeom, OGRSpatialReferenceH hSRS)

Transform geometry to new spatial reference system.

This function will transform the coordinates of a geometry from their
current spatial reference system to a new target spatial reference
system. Normally this means reprojecting the vectors, but it could
include datum shifts, and changes of units.

This function will only work if the geometry already has an assigned
spatial reference system, and if it is transformable to the target
coordinate system.

Because this function requires internal creation and initialization of
an OGRCoordinateTransformation object it is significantly more
expensive to use this function to transform many geometries than it is
to create the OGRCoordinateTransformation in advance, and call
transform() with that transformation. This function exists primarily
for convenience when only transforming a single geometry.

This function is the same as the CPP method OGRGeometry::transformTo.

Parameters:
-----------

hGeom:  handle on the geometry to apply the transform to.

hSRS:  handle on the spatial reference system to apply.

This function will transform the coordinates of a geometry from their
current spatial reference system to a new target spatial reference
system. Normally this means reprojecting the vectors, but it could
include datum shifts, and changes of units.

Note that this function does not require that the geometry already
have a spatial reference system. It will be assumed that they can be
treated as having the source spatial reference system of the
OGRCoordinateTransformation object, and the actual SRS of the geometry
will be ignored. On successful completion the output
OGRSpatialReference of the OGRCoordinateTransformation will be
assigned to the geometry.

OGR_G_Simplify(OGRGeometryH hThis, double dTolerance)

Compute a simplified geometry.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRGeometry::Simplify().

This function is built on the GEOS library, check it for the
definition of the geometry operation. If OGR is built without the GEOS
library, this function will always fail, issuing a CPLE_NotSupported
error.

Parameters:
-----------

hThis:  the geometry.

dTolerance:  the distance tolerance for the simplification.

the simplified geometry or NULL if an error occurs.
