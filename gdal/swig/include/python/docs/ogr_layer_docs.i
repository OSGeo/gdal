OGR_L_GetFeatureCount(OGRLayerH hLayer, int bForce)

Fetch the feature count in this layer.

Returns the number of features in the layer. For dynamic databases the
count may not be exact. If bForce is FALSE, and it would be expensive
to establish the feature count a value of -1 may be returned
indicating that the count isn't know. If bForce is TRUE some
implementations will actually scan the entire layer once to count
objects.

The returned count takes the spatial filter into account.

Note that some implementations of this method may alter the read
cursor of the layer.

This function is the same as the CPP OGRLayer::GetFeatureCount().

Note: since GDAL 2.0, this method returns a GIntBig (previously a int)

Parameters:

it is expensive.

Fetch the extent of this layer.

Returns the extent (MBR) of the data in the layer. If bForce is FALSE,
and it would be expensive to establish the extent then OGRERR_FAILURE
will be returned indicating that the extent isn't know. If bForce is
TRUE then some implementations will actually scan the entire layer
once to compute the MBR of all the features in the layer.

Depending on the drivers, the returned extent may or may not take the
spatial filter into account. So it is safer to call OGR_L_GetExtent()
without setting a spatial filter.

Layers without any geometry may return OGRERR_FAILURE just indicating
that no meaningful extents could be collected.

Note that some implementations of this method may alter the read
cursor of the layer.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::GetExtent().

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer from which to get extent.

psExtent:  the structure in which the extent value will be returned.

bForce:  Flag indicating whether the extent should be computed even if
it is expensive.

%feature("docstring")  SetAttributeFilter "OGRErr
OGR_L_SetAttributeFilter(OGRLayerH hLayer, const char *pszQuery)

Set a new attribute query.

This function sets the attribute query string to be used when fetching
features via the OGR_L_GetNextFeature() function. Only features for
which the query evaluates as true will be returned.

The query string should be in the format of an SQL WHERE clause. For
instance \"population > 1000000 and population < 5000000\" where
population is an attribute in the layer. The query format is a
restricted form of SQL WHERE clause as defined
\"eq_format=restricted_where\" about half way through this document:

http://ogdi.sourceforge.net/prop/6.2.CapabilitiesMetadata.html

Note that installing a query string will generally result in resetting
the current reading position (ala OGR_L_ResetReading()).

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRLayer::SetAttributeFilter().

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer on which attribute query will be
executed.

pszQuery:  query in restricted SQL WHERE format, or NULL to clear the
current query.

OGRERR_NONE if successfully installed, or an error code if the query
expression is in error, or some other failure occurs. ";

%feature("docstring")  GetFeature "OGRFeatureH
OGR_L_GetFeature(OGRLayerH hLayer, GIntBig nFeatureId)

Fetch a feature by its identifier.

This function will attempt to read the identified feature. The nFID
value cannot be OGRNullFID. Success or failure of this operation is
unaffected by the spatial or attribute filters (and specialized
implementations in drivers should make sure that they do not take into
account spatial or attribute filters).

If this function returns a non-NULL feature, it is guaranteed that its
feature id ( OGR_F_GetFID()) will be the same as nFID.

Use OGR_L_TestCapability(OLCRandomRead) to establish if this layer
supports efficient random access reading via OGR_L_GetFeature();
however, the call should always work if the feature exists as a
fallback implementation just scans all the features in the layer
looking for the desired feature.

Sequential reads (with OGR_L_GetNextFeature()) are generally
considered interrupted by a OGR_L_GetFeature() call.

The returned feature should be free with OGR_F_Destroy().

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::GetFeature( ).

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer that owned the feature.

nFeatureId:  the feature id of the feature to read.

an handle to a feature now owned by the caller, or NULL on failure. ";

%feature("docstring")  SetNextByIndex "OGRErr
OGR_L_SetNextByIndex(OGRLayerH hLayer, GIntBig nIndex)

Move read cursor to the nIndex'th feature in the current resultset.

This method allows positioning of a layer such that the
GetNextFeature() call will read the requested feature, where nIndex is
an absolute index into the current result set. So, setting it to 3
would mean the next feature read with GetNextFeature() would have been
the 4th feature to have been read if sequential reading took place
from the beginning of the layer, including accounting for spatial and
attribute filters.

Only in rare circumstances is SetNextByIndex() efficiently
implemented. In all other cases the default implementation which calls
ResetReading() and then calls GetNextFeature() nIndex times is used.
To determine if fast seeking is available on the current layer use the
TestCapability() method with a value of OLCFastSetNextByIndex.

This method is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::SetNextByIndex()

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer

nIndex:  the index indicating how many steps into the result set to
seek.

OGRERR_NONE on success or an error code. ";

%feature("docstring")  GetNextFeature "OGRFeatureH
OGR_L_GetNextFeature(OGRLayerH hLayer)

Fetch the next available feature from this layer.

The returned feature becomes the responsibility of the caller to
delete with OGR_F_Destroy(). It is critical that all features
associated with an OGRLayer (more specifically an OGRFeatureDefn) be
deleted before that layer/datasource is deleted.

Only features matching the current spatial filter (set with
SetSpatialFilter()) will be returned.

This function implements sequential access to the features of a layer.
The OGR_L_ResetReading() function can be used to start at the
beginning again.

Features returned by OGR_GetNextFeature() may or may not be affected
by concurrent modifications depending on drivers. A guaranteed way of
seeing modifications in effect is to call OGR_L_ResetReading() on
layers where OGR_GetNextFeature() has been called, before reading
again. Structural changes in layers (field addition, deletion, ...)
when a read is in progress may or may not be possible depending on
drivers. If a transaction is committed/aborted, the current sequential
reading may or may not be valid after that operation and a call to
OGR_L_ResetReading() might be needed.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRLayer::GetNextFeature().

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer from which feature are read.

an handle to a feature, or NULL if no more features are available. ";

%feature("docstring")  SetFeature "OGRErr OGR_L_SetFeature(OGRLayerH

Rewrite an existing feature.

This function will write a feature to the layer, based on the feature
id within the OGRFeature.

Use OGR_L_TestCapability(OLCRandomWrite) to establish if this layer
supports random access writing via OGR_L_SetFeature().

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::SetFeature().

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer to write the feature.

hFeat:  the feature to write.

OGRERR_NONE if the operation works, otherwise an appropriate error
code (e.g OGRERR_NON_EXISTING_FEATURE if the feature does not exist).
";

%feature("docstring")  CreateFeature "OGRErr
OGR_L_CreateFeature(OGRLayerH hLayer, OGRFeatureH hFeat)

Create and write a new feature within a layer.

The passed feature is written to the layer as a new feature, rather
than overwriting an existing one. If the feature has a feature id
other than OGRNullFID, then the native implementation may use that as
the feature id of the new feature, but not necessarily. Upon
successful return the passed feature will have been updated with the
new feature id.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::CreateFeature().

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer to write the feature to.

hFeat:  the handle of the feature to write to disk.

Applications should never modify the OGRFeatureDefn used by a layer
directly.

This function should not be called while there are feature objects in
existence that were obtained or created with the previous layer
definition.

Not all drivers support this function. You can query a layer to check
if it supports it with the OLCCreateField capability. Some drivers may
only support this method while there are still no features in the
layer. When it is supported, the existing features of the backing
file/database should be updated accordingly.

Drivers may or may not support not-null constraints. If they support
creating fields with not-null constraints, this is generally before
creating any feature to the layer.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::CreateField().

Parameters:
-----------

hLayer:  handle to the layer to write the field definition.

hField:  handle of the field definition to write to disk.

You must use this to reorder existing fields on a real layer.
Internally the OGRFeatureDefn for the layer will be updated to reflect
the reordering of the fields. Applications should never modify the
OGRFeatureDefn used by a layer directly.

This function should not be called while there are feature objects in
existence that were obtained or created with the previous layer
definition.

panMap is such that,for each field definition at position i after
reordering, its position before reordering was panMap[i].

For example, let suppose the fields were \"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"
initially. ReorderFields([0,2,3,1,4]) will reorder them as
\"0\",\"2\",\"3\",\"1\",\"4\".

Not all drivers support this function. You can query a layer to check

If starting the transaction fails, will return OGRERR_FAILURE.
Datasources which do not support transactions will always return
OGRERR_NONE.

Note: as of GDAL 2.0, use of this API is discouraged when the dataset
offers dataset level transaction with GDALDataset::StartTransaction().
The reason is that most drivers can only offer transactions at dataset

Set a new spatial filter.

This function set the geometry to be used as a spatial filter when
fetching features via the OGR_L_GetNextFeature() function. Only
features that geometrically intersect the filter geometry will be
returned.

Currently this test is may be inaccurately implemented, but it is
guaranteed that all features who's envelope (as returned by

strictly be the case.

This function makes an internal copy of the passed geometry. The
passed geometry remains the responsibility of the caller, and may be
safely destroyed.

For the time being the passed filter geometry should be in the same
SRS as the layer (as returned by OGR_L_GetSpatialRef()). In the future
this may be generalized.

Flush pending changes to disk.

This call is intended to force the layer to flush any pending writes
to disk, and leave the disk file in a consistent state. It would not
normally have any effect on read-only datasources.

Some layers do not implement this method, and will still return
OGRERR_NONE. The default implementation just returns OGRERR_NONE. An
error is only returned if an error occurs while attempting to flush to
disk.

In any event, you should always close any opened datasource with
OGR_DS_Destroy() that will ensure all data is correctly flushed.

This method is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::SyncToDisk()

Parameters:

Delete feature from layer.

The feature with the indicated feature id is deleted from the layer if
supported by the driver. Most drivers do not support feature deletion,
and will return OGRERR_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION. The
OGR_L_TestCapability() function may be called with OLCDeleteFeature to
check if the driver supports feature deletion.

This method is the same as the C++ method OGRLayer::DeleteFeature().

Parameters:

OGR_L_SetIgnoredFields(OGRLayerH hLayer, const char **papszFields)

Set which fields can be omitted when retrieving features from the

If the driver supports this functionality (testable using
OLCIgnoreFields capability), it will not fetch the specified fields in
subsequent calls to GetFeature() / GetNextFeature() and thus save some
processing time and/or bandwidth.

Besides field names of the layers, the following special fields can be
passed: \"OGR_GEOMETRY\" to ignore geometry and \"OGR_STYLE\" to
ignore layer style.

By default, no fields are ignored.
