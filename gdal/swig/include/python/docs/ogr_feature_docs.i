feature will adhere.

or, starting with GDAL 2.1, NULL in case out of memory situation. ";

DLL and they want to delete a feature created within the DLL. If the
delete is done in the calling application the memory will be freed
onto the application heap which is inappropriate.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetField().

This method has only an effect on the in-memory feature object. If

afterwards. Or if this is a new feature, OGR_L_CreateFeature() must be
used afterwards.

%feature("docstring")  SetFieldRaw "void
OGR_F_SetFieldRaw(OGRFeatureH hFeat, int iField, OGRField *psValue)

Set field.

The passed value OGRField must be of exactly the same type as the
target field, or an application crash may occur. The passed value is
copied, and will not be affected. It remains the responsibility of the
caller.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetField().

This method has only an effect on the in-memory feature object. If
this object comes from a layer and the modifications must be
serialized back to the datasource, OGR_L_SetFeature() must be used

%feature("docstring")  DumpReadable "void
OGR_F_DumpReadable(OGRFeatureH hFeat, FILE *fpOut)

Dump this feature in a human readable form.

This dumps the attributes, and geometry; however, it doesn't
definition information (other than field types and names), nor does it
report the geometry spatial reference system.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRFeature::DumpReadable().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to the feature to dump.

fpOut:  the stream to write to, such as strout. ";

%feature("docstring")  GetFID "GIntBig OGR_F_GetFID(OGRFeatureH

long)

Parameters:

%feature("docstring")  SetFID "OGRErr OGR_F_SetFID(OGRFeatureH hFeat,
GIntBig nFID)

Set the feature identifier.

For specific types of features this operation may fail on illegal
features ids. Generally it always succeeds. Feature ids should be
greater than or equal to zero, with the exception of OGRNullFID (-1)
indicating that the feature id is unknown.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetFID().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to the feature to set the feature id to.

nFID:  the new feature identifier value to assign.

On success OGRERR_NONE, or on failure some other value. ";

%feature("docstring")  Equal "int OGR_F_Equal(OGRFeatureH hFeat,

Test if two features are the same.

Two features are considered equal if the share them (handle equality)
same OGRFeatureDefn, have the same field values, and the same geometry
(as tested by OGR_G_Equal()) as well as the same feature id.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::Equal().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to one of the feature.

hOtherFeat:  handle to the other feature to test this one against.

TRUE if they are equal, otherwise FALSE. ";

%feature("docstring")  SetFrom "OGRErr OGR_F_SetFrom(OGRFeatureH
hFeat, OGRFeatureH hOtherFeat, int bForgiving)

Set one feature from another.

Overwrite the contents of this feature from the geometry and
attributes of another. The hOtherFeature does not need to have the
same OGRFeatureDefn. Field values are copied by corresponding field
names. Field types do not have to exactly match. OGR_F_SetField*()
function conversion rules will be applied as needed.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetFrom().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to the feature to set to.

hOtherFeat:  handle to the feature from which geometry, and field
values will be copied.

bForgiving:  TRUE if the operation should continue despite lacking
output fields matching some of the source fields.

transferred, otherwise an error code. ";

%feature("docstring")  SetFromWithMap "OGRErr
OGR_F_SetFromWithMap(OGRFeatureH hFeat, OGRFeatureH hOtherFeat, int
bForgiving, const int *panMap)

Set one feature from another.

Overwrite the contents of this feature from the geometry and
attributes of another. The hOtherFeature does not need to have the
same OGRFeatureDefn. Field values are copied according to the provided
indices map. Field types do not have to exactly match.
OGR_F_SetField*() function conversion rules will be applied as needed.
This is more efficient than OGR_F_SetFrom() in that this doesn't
lookup the fields by their names. Particularly useful when the field
names don't match.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetFrom().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to the feature to set to.

hOtherFeat:  handle to the feature from which geometry, and field
values will be copied.

panMap:  Array of the indices of the destination feature's fields
stored at the corresponding index of the source feature's fields. A
value of -1 should be used to ignore the source's field. The array
should not be NULL and be as long as the number of fields in the
source feature.

bForgiving:  TRUE if the operation should continue despite lacking
output fields matching some of the source fields.

OGRERR_NONE if the operation succeeds, even if some values are not
transferred, otherwise an error code. ";

%feature("docstring")  Validate "int OGR_F_Validate(OGRFeatureH
hFeat, int nValidateFlags, int bEmitError)

Validate that a feature meets constraints of its schema.

The scope of test is specified with the nValidateFlags parameter.

Regarding OGR_F_VAL_WIDTH, the test is done assuming the string width
must be interpreted as the number of UTF-8 characters. Some drivers
might interpret the width as the number of bytes instead. So this test
is rather conservative (if it fails, then it will fail for all
interpretations).

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::Validate().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to the feature to validate.

nValidateFlags:  OGR_F_VAL_ALL or combination of OGR_F_VAL_NULL,
OGR_F_VAL_GEOM_TYPE, OGR_F_VAL_WIDTH and
OGR_F_VAL_ALLOW_NULL_WHEN_DEFAULT with '|' operator

bEmitError:  TRUE if a CPLError() must be emitted when a check fails

TRUE if all enabled validation tests pass.

%feature("docstring")  GetNativeData "const char*
OGR_F_GetNativeData(OGRFeatureH hFeat)

Returns the native data for the feature.

The native data is the representation in a \"natural\" form that comes
from the driver that created this feature, or that is aimed at an
output driver. The native data may be in different format, which is
indicated by OGR_F_GetNativeMediaType().

Note that most drivers do not support storing the native data in the
feature object, and if they do, generally the NATIVE_DATA open option
must be passed at dataset opening.

The \"native data\" does not imply it is something more performant or
powerful than what can be obtained with the rest of the API, but it
may be useful in round-tripping scenarios where some characteristics
of the underlying format are not captured otherwise by the OGR
abstraction.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRFeature::GetNativeData().

Parameters:
-----------

hFeat:  handle to the feature.

a string with the native data, or NULL if there is none.
