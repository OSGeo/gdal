%feature("docstring")  CreateDataSource "OGRDataSourceH
OGR_Dr_CreateDataSource(OGRSFDriverH hDriver, const char *pszName,
char **papszOptions)

This function attempts to create a new data source based on the passed
driver.

The papszOptions argument can be used to control driver specific
creation options. These options are normally documented in the format
specific documentation.

It is important to call OGR_DS_Destroy() when the datasource is no
longer used to ensure that all data has been properly flushed to disk.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRSFDriver::CreateDataSource().

Parameters:
-----------

hDriver:  handle to the driver on which data source creation is based.

pszName:  the name for the new data source. UTF-8 encoded.

papszOptions:  a StringList of name=value options. Options are driver
specific, and driver information can be found at the following
url:http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html

NULL is returned on failure, or a new OGRDataSource handle on success.
";

%feature("docstring")  DeleteDataSource "OGRErr
OGR_Dr_DeleteDataSource(OGRSFDriverH hDriver, const char
*pszDataSource)

Delete a datasource.

Delete (from the disk, in the database, ...) the named datasource.
Normally it would be safest if the datasource was not open at the
time.

Whether this is a supported operation on this driver case be tested
using TestCapability() on ODrCDeleteDataSource.

This method is the same as the C++ method
OGRSFDriver::DeleteDataSource().

Parameters:
-----------

hDriver:  handle to the driver on which data source deletion is based.

pszDataSource:  the name of the datasource to delete.

OGRERR_NONE on success, and OGRERR_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION if this is
not supported by this driver. ";

%feature("docstring")  GetName "const char*
OGR_Dr_GetName(OGRSFDriverH hDriver)

Fetch name of driver (file format). This name should be relatively
short (10-40 characters), and should reflect the underlying file
format. For instance \"ESRI Shapefile\".

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRSFDriver::GetName().

Parameters:
-----------

hDriver:  handle to the driver to get the name from.

driver name. This is an internal string and should not be modified or
freed. ";

%feature("docstring")  Open "OGRDataSourceH OGR_Dr_Open(OGRSFDriverH
hDriver, const char *pszName, int bUpdate)

Attempt to open file with this driver.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRSFDriver::Open().

Parameters:
-----------

hDriver:  handle to the driver that is used to open file.

pszName:  the name of the file, or data source to try and open.

bUpdate:  TRUE if update access is required, otherwise FALSE (the
default).

NULL on error or if the pass name is not supported by this driver,
otherwise an handle to an OGRDataSource. This OGRDataSource should be
closed by deleting the object when it is no longer needed. ";

%feature("docstring")  TestCapability "int
OGR_Dr_TestCapability(OGRSFDriverH hDriver, const char *pszCap)

Test if capability is available.

One of the following data source capability names can be passed into
this function, and a TRUE or FALSE value will be returned indicating
whether or not the capability is available for this object.

ODrCCreateDataSource: True if this driver can support creating data
sources.

ODrCDeleteDataSource: True if this driver supports deleting data
sources.

The #define macro forms of the capability names should be used in
preference to the strings themselves to avoid misspelling.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRSFDriver::TestCapability().

Parameters:
-----------

hDriver:  handle to the driver to test the capability against.

pszCap:  the capability to test.

TRUE if capability available otherwise FALSE. ";

%feature("docstring")  CopyDataSource "OGRDataSourceH
OGR_Dr_CopyDataSource(OGRSFDriverH hDriver, OGRDataSourceH hSrcDS,
const char *pszNewName, char **papszOptions)

This function creates a new datasource by copying all the layers from
the source datasource.

It is important to call OGR_DS_Destroy() when the datasource is no
longer used to ensure that all data has been properly flushed to disk.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRSFDriver::CopyDataSource().

Parameters:
-----------

hDriver:  handle to the driver on which data source creation is based.

hSrcDS:  source datasource

pszNewName:  the name for the new data source.

papszOptions:  a StringList of name=value options. Options are driver
specific, and driver information can be found at the following
url:http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html

NULL is returned on failure, or a new OGRDataSource handle on success.
