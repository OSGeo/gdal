Geo-GDAL
=======================

This is the swig-generated Perl interface to the GDAL/OGR library.

INSTALLATION

This module will be built and installed as a part of gdal build and
installation, if you use --with-perl in configure of gdal. That
process is controlled by GNUmakefile.

The build process comprises three steps:

1) generating the wrappers, requires swig

make generate

2) making the four makefiles

perl Makefile.PL

NOTE-----------NOTE-----------NOTE-----------NOTE-----------NOTE

NOTE: The Perl bindings use ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which accepts (from
version 6.31) argument INSTALL_BASE to change where the module will be
installed.

http://perldoc.perl.org/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html#INSTALL_BASE

GNUmakefile in this directory calls

	perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=$(INST_PREFIX)

to honor the overall location where GDAL is to be installed.  It seems
that plain "perl Makefile.PL" is different from "perl Makefile.PL
INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local" in that the former will install into
/usr/local/lib/perl and the latter will install into
/usr/local/lib/perl5. This feature is in version 7.04 of
ExtUtils::MakeMaker. It may easily lead to several versions of
Geo::GDAL in your machine.

3) making the bindings

make -f Makefile_Geo__GDAL
make -f Makefile_Geo__GDAL__Const
make -f Makefile_Geo__OGR
make -f Makefile_Geo__OSR

this is done by simple 'make' with the help of the GNUmakefile
or Makefile in the case of dmake.

The bindings may be tested with

make test

You may need to edit the Makefile.PL.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is maintained in Doxygen files. You will also need
Doxygen-Filter-Perl. To generate the documentation type

make doc
