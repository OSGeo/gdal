Geo-GDAL
=======================

This is the swig-generated Perl interface to the GDAL/OGR library, the
same one which is distributed with GDAL. GDAL is available from
www.gdal.org.

You need to have the development (header files etc.) versions of gdal and
geos libraries available in your system to build these modules.

The versions of GDAL and this interface must match. Makefile.PL does that.

This module is _not_ compatible with Geo::GDAL 0.11

INSTALLATION

Perl Makefile.PL generates four Makefiles. There is a master Makefile in 
this distro.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In MinGW it is 

   perl Makefile.PL
   dmake 
   dmake test
   dmake install

You may need to edit the Makefile.PL.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the GDAL library.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is maintained in Doxygen files. Doxygen is available
at www.doxygen.org. You will also need Perl Doxygen Filter from
http://www.bigsister.ch/doxygenfilter/ and my extension to it from
http://map.hut.fi/files/doxygenfilter/. To generate the documentation
type

    doxygen

You can find the documentation also at
http://map.hut.fi/doc/Geo-GDAL/html/. However, Tthe comprehensive
documentation of GDAL and OGR are at http://www.gdal.org/.
