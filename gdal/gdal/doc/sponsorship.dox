\page sponsorship Sponsoring GDAL/OGR

Development and maintenance of GDAL/OGR is supported by organizations 
contracting developers, organizations contributing improvements, users 
contributing improvements, and volunteers.  Generally speaking this works
well, and GDAL/OGR has improved substantially over the years.

However, there are still many tasks which do not receive the attention they
should.  Processing bug reports, writing documentation, writing test scripts, 
evaluating test script failures and user support often receive less 
attention than would be desired.  Some new features of broad interest are
not implemented because they aren't important enough to any one person or
organization.

In order to provide sustained funding to support the maintenance, improvement
and promotion of the GDAL/OGR project, the project seeks project sponsors to 
provide financial support.  Sponsorship would be accomplished via the 
<a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Project_Sponsorship">OSGeo 
Project Sponsorship</a> program.  Funds are held by OSGeo for disposition
on behalf of the project, and dispersed at the discretion of the GDAL/OGR
Project Steering Committee.

\section ss_uses Sponsorship Uses

The primary intended use of the sponsorship funds is to hire a maintainer
on a contract basis.  The responsibilities would include:

<ul>
<li> Addressing bug reports - reproducing then fixing or passing on to another developer.
<li> Extending, and running the test suite. 
<li> Improving documentation.
<li> Other improvements to the software. 
<li> General user support on the mailing list. 
</ul>

Sponsorship funds may also be used to contract for specific improvements to 
GDAL, provision of resources such as web hosting, funding code sprints, 
or funding project promotion.  Decisions on spending of sponsorship funds
will be made by the GDAL/OGR Project Steering Committee.
