<h1>BAG --- Bathymetry Attributed Grid</h1>

This driver provides read-only support for bathymetry data in the BAG format.
BAG files are actually a specific product profile in an HDF5 file, but a
custom driver exists to present the data in a more convenient manner than
is available through the generic HDF5 driver.<p>

BAG files have two or three image bands representing Elevation (band 1),
Uncertainty (band 2) and Nominal Elevation (band 3) values for each cell in a
raster grid area.<p>

The geotransform and coordinate system is extracted from the internal XML
metadata provided with the dataset.  However, some products may have
unsupported coordinate system formats.<p>

The full XML metadata is available in the "xml:BAG" metadata domain.<p>

Nodata, minimum and maximum values for each band are also provided.<p>
