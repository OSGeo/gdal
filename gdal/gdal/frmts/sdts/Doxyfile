# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of word surrounded
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)

# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY     =

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put.
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

# put in front of it. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default path.

# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

INPUT            =	. ../iso8211 ../../port

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank all files are included.

# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO.
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE        = NO

# The INPUT_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program that doxygen should
# invoke to filter for each input file. Doxygen will invoke the filter program 
# by executing (via popen()) the command <filter> <input-file>, where <filter>
# is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the name of an
# input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter program writes
# to standard output.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# evaluate all C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include
# files.

# names in the source code. If set to NO (the default) only conditional 
# compilation will be performed.

# in the INCLUDE_PATH (see below) will be search if a #include is found.

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by
# the preprocessor.

INCLUDE_PATH =

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name
# or name=definition (no spaces). In the former case 1 is used as the
# definition.

# a tag file that is based on the input files it reads.

# cgi binaries are located. See the documentation of your http daemon for 
# details.

# documentation is located. If left blank the absolute path to the 
# documentation, with file:// prepended to it, will be used.

DOC_URL          =

# The DOC_ABSPATH tag should be the absolute path to the directory where the
# documentation is located. If left blank the directory on the local machine
# will be used.

# The BIN_ABSPATH tag must point to the directory where the doxysearch binary
# is installed.

BIN_ABSPATH      = /usr/local/bin/
