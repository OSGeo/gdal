<h1>ISIS3 -- USGS Astrogeology ISIS Cube (Version 3)</h1>

ISIS3 is a format used by the USGS Planetary Cartography group
to store and distribute planetary imagery data.  GDAL provides
read-only access to ISIS3 formatted imagery data.<p>

ISIS3 files often have the extension .cub, sometimes with an associated
.lbl (label) file.  When a .lbl file exists it should be used as
the dataset name rather than the .cub file.<p>

In addition to support for most ISIS3 imagery configurations, this
driver also reads georeferencing and coordinate system information
as well as selected other header metadata.<p>

Implementation of this driver was supported by the United States
Geological Survey.<p>

ISIS3 is part of a family of related formats including PDS and ISIS2.<p>
