<h1>ODS - Open Document Spreadsheet</h1>

(GDAL/OGR &gt;= 1.10.0)<p>

This driver can read, write and update spreadsheets in Open Document Spreadsheet format, used by applications like OpenOffice / LibreOffice / KSpread / etc...<p>

The driver is only available if GDAL/OGR is compiled against the Expat library.<p>

Each sheet is presented as a OGR layer. No geometry support is available directly (but you may use the OGR VRT capabilities for that).<p>

Note 1 : spreadsheets with passwords are not supported.<p>

Note 2 : when updating an existing document, all existing styles, formatting, formulas and other concepts (charts, drawings, macros, ...)
not understood by OGR will be lost : the document is re-written from scratch from the OGR data model.<p>

<h3>Configuration options</h3>

<ul>
<li>OGR_ODS_HEADERS = FORCE / DISABLE / AUTO : By default, the driver will read the first lines of each sheet to detect if the
first line might be the name of columns. If set to FORCE, the driver will consider the first line will be taken as the header line.
If set to DISABLE, it will be considered as the first feature. Otherwise auto-detection will occur.</li>
<li>OGR_ODS_FIELD_TYPES = STRING / AUTO : By default, the driver will try to detect the data type of fields. If set to STRING,
all fields will be of String type.</li>
</ul>
