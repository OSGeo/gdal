<h1>Microstation DGN</h1>

Microstation DGN files from Microstation versions predating version 8.0
are supported for reading.  The entire file is represented as one layer
(named "elements").<p>

DGN files are considered to have no georeferencing information through OGR.
Features will all have the following generic attributes:

<ul>
<li> Type: The integer type code as listed below in supported elements.
<li> Level: The DGN level number (0-63).
<li> GraphicGroup: The graphic group number.
<li> ColorIndex: The color index from the dgn palette.
<li> Weight: The drawing weight (thickness) for the element.
<li> Style: The style value for the element.
</ul>

DGN files do not contain spatial indexes; however, the DGN driver does take
advantage of the extents information at the beginning of each element to
minimize processing of elements outside the current spatial filter window
when in effect.<p>

<h2>Supported Elements</h2>

The following element types are supported:<p>

<ul>
<li> Line (3): Line geometry.
<li> Line String (4): Multi segment line geometry.
<li> Shape (6): Polygon geometry.
<li> Curve (11): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> B-Spline (21): Treated (inaccurately) as a line geometry.
<li> Arc (16): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> Ellipse (15): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> Text (17): Treated as a point geometry.
</ul>

Generally speaking any concept of complex objects, and cells as associated
components is lost.  Each component of a complex object or cell is treated
as a independent feature.<p>

<h2>Styling Information</h2>

Some drawing information about features can be extracted from the ColorIndex,
Weight and Style generic attributes; however, for all features an OGR
style string has been prepared with the values encoded in ready-to-use form
for applications supporting OGR style strings.<p>

The various kinds of linear geometries will carry style information indicating
the color, thickness and line style (i.e. dotted, solid, etc).<p>

Polygons (Shape elements) will carry styling information for the edge as well
as a fill color if provided.  Fill patterns are not supported.<p>

Text elements will contain the text, angle, color and size information
(expressed in ground units) in the style string.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

2D DGN files may be written with OGR with significant limitations:<P>

<ul>
<li> Output features have the usual fixed DGN attributes.  Attempts to create
any other fields will fail.<p>

<li> Virtual no effort is currently made to translate OGR feature style
strings back into DGN representation information. <p>

<li> POINT geometries that are not text (Text is NULL, and the feature
style string is not a LABEL) will be translated as a degenerate (0 length)
line element. <p>

<li> Polygon, and multipolygon objects will be translated to simple polygons
with all rings other than the first discarded.<p>

<li> Polygons and line strings with too many vertices will be split into
a group of elements prefixed with a Complex Shape Header or Complex Chain
Header element as appropriate. <p>

<li> A seed file must be provided (or if not provided,
$PREFIX/share/gdal/seed_2d.dgn will be used).  Many aspects of the resulting
DGN file are determined by the seed file, and cannot be affected via OGR,
such as initial view window. <p>

<li> The various collection geometries other than MultiPolygon are completely
discarded at this time. <p>

<li> Geometries which fall outside the "design plane" of the seed file will
be discarded, or corrupted in unpredictable ways.<p>

<li> DGN files can only have one layer.  Attempts
to create more than one layer in a DGN file will fail.<p>

</ul>

The dataset creation supports the following options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>3D=</b><i>YES</i> or <i>NO</i>: Determine whether 2D (seed_2d.dgn)
or 3D (seed_3d.dgn) seed file should be used.  This option is ignored if the
SEED option is provided.<p>

<li> <b>SEED=</b><i>filename</i>: Override the seed file to use.<p>

<li> <b>COPY_WHOLE_SEED_FILE=</b><i>YES/NO</i>: Indicate whether the whole
seed file should be copied.  If not, only the first three elements (and
potentially the color table) will be copied.  Default is NO.<p>

<li> <b>COPY_SEED_FILE_COLOR_TABLE=</b><i>YES/NO</i>: Indicates whether the
color table should be copied from the seed file.  By default this is NO. <p>

<li> <b>MASTER_UNIT_NAME=</b><i>name</i>: Override the master unit name from
the seed file with the provided one or two character unit name. <p>

<li> <b>SUB_UNIT_NAME=</b><i>name</i>: Override the sub unit name from
the seed file with the provided one or two character unit name. <p>

<li> <b>SUB_UNITS_PER_MASTER_UNIT=</b><i>count</i>: Override the number of
subunits per master unit.  By default the seed file value is used.<p>

<li> <b>UOR_PER_SUB_UNIT=</b><i>count</i>: Override the number of
UORs (Units of Resolution) per sub unit.  By default the seed file value is
used.<p>

<li> <b>ORIGIN</b>=<i>x,y,z</i>: Override the origin of the design plane.  By
default the origin from the seed file is used.<p>
