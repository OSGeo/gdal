<h1>Idrisi Vector (.VCT)</h1>

(GDAL/OGR >= 1.9.0)<p>

This driver reads Idrisi vector files with .vct extension. The driver
recognized point, lines and polygons geometries.<p>

For geographical referencing identification, the .vdc file contains information
that points to a file that holds the geographic reference details. Those files
uses extension REF and  resides in the same folder as the RST image or more
likely in the Idrisi installation folders.<p>

Therefore the presence or absence of the Idrisi software in the running operation
system will determine the way that this driver will work. By setting the
environment variable IDRISIDIR pointing to the Idrisi main installation folder
will enable GDAL to find more detailed information about geographical reference
and projection in the REF files.<p>

Note that the driver recognizes the name convention used in Idrisi for UTM and
State Plane geographic reference so it doesn't need to access the REF files. That
is the case for RDC file that specify "utm-30n" or "spc87ma1" in the "ref. system"
field. Note that exporting to RST in any other geographical reference system will
generate a suggested REF content in the comment section of the RDC file.<p>

Starting with OGR 1.10, the driver can retrieve attributes from .ADC / .AVL ASCII files.<p>
