<h1>OpenAir - OpenAir Special Use Airspace Format</h1>

(GDAL/OGR >= 1.8.0)<p>

This driver reads files describing Special Use Airspaces in the OpenAir format<p>

Airspace are returned as features of a single layer called 'airspaces', with a
geometry of type Polygon and the following fields: CLASS, NAME, FLOOR, CEILING.
<p>

Airspace geometries made of arcs will be tessellated. Styling information when
present is returned at the feature level.<p>

An extra layer called 'labels' will contain a feature for each label (AT
element). There can be multiple AT records for a single airspace segment. The
fields are the same as the 'airspaces' layer.<p>
