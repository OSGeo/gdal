<h1>OGDI -- OGDI Bridge</h1>

<b><u>Note</u></b> : From GDAL >= 1.5.0, there should be little reason to use the
OGDI raster bridge, as <a href="frmt_various.html#ADRG">ADRG</a>,
<a href="frmt_dted.html">DTED</a> and <a href="frmt_various.html#RPFTOC">RPF</a>
(CADRG/CIB) formats are natively supported by GDAL.<br><br>

OGDI raster data sources are supported by GDAL for reading.  Both Matrix
and Image families should be fully supported, as well as reading of colormap
and projection metadata.  The GDAL reader is intended
to be used with OGDI 3.1 drivers, but OGDI 3.0 drivers should also work.<p>

OGDI datasets are opened within GDAL by selecting the GLTP URL.  For
instance, gltp://gdal.velocet.ca/adrg/usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPSUS0101 would open
the ADRG dataset stored at /usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPSUS0101 on the machine
gdal.velocet.ca (assuming it has an OGDI server running) using the 'adrg'
driver.  This default access to a whole datastore will attempt to represent
all layers (and all supported family types) as bands all at the resolution
and region reported by the datastore when initially accessed.<p>

It is also possible to select a particular layer and access family
from an OGDI datastore by indicating the layer name family in the name.
The GDAL dataset name
gltp:/adrg/usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPUS0101:"TPUS0102.IMG":Matrix would select
the layer named TPUS0102.IMG from the dataset /usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPUS0101
on the local system using the ADRG driver, and access the Matrix family.
When a specific layer is accessed in this manner GDAL will attempt to determine
the region and resolution from the OGDI 3.1 capabilities document.  Note that
OGDI 3.0 datastores must have the layer and family specified in the
dataset name since they cannot be determined automatically.<p>

<pre>
eg.
  gltp://gdal.velocet.ca/adrg/usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPUS0101
  gltp:/adrg/usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPUS0101
  gltp:/adrg/usr4/mpp1/adrg/TPUS0101:"TPUS0102.IMG":Matrix
</pre>

OGDI Matrix family layers (pseudocolored integer layers) are represented
as a single band of raster data with a color table.  Though the Matrix layers
contain 32bit integer values, they are represented through GDAL as eight
layers.  All values over 255 are truncated to 255, and only 256 colormap
entries are captured.  While this works well for most Matrix layers, it is
anticipated that at some point in the future Matrix layers with a larger
dynamic range will be represented as other data types. <p>

OGDI Image family layers may internally have a type of RGB (1) which is
represented as three 8bit bands in GDAL, or Byte (2), UInt16 (3), Int16 (4)
or Int32 (5).   There is no support for floating points bands in OGDI 3.1.<p>

The GDAL OGDI driver will represent OGDI datasources as having <i>arbitrary</i>
overviews.  Any GDAL raster read requests at a reduced resolution will be
passed on to the OGDI driver at that reduced resolution; potentially allowing
efficient reading of overview information from OGDI datastores.<p>

If an OGDI datastore is opened without selecting a layer name in the dataset
name, and if the datastore has OGDI 3.1 style capabilities, the list of layers
will be made available as SUBDATASETS metadata.  For instance, the
<i>gdalinfo</i> command might report the following.  This information can be
used to establish available layers for direct access.<p>
