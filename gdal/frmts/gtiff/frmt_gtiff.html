<h1>GTiff -- GeoTIFF File Format</h1>

Most forms of TIFF and GeoTIFF files are supported by GDAL for reading, and
somewhat less varieties can be written.<p>

Currently band types of Byte, UInt16, Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float32, Float64, 
CInt16, CInt32, CFloat32 and CFloat64 are supported for
reading and writing.  
Paletted images will return palette information associated with
the band.  The compression formats listed below should be supported for
reading as well. <p>

As well, one bit files, and some other unusual formulations of GeoTIFF file,
such as YCbCr color model files, are automatically translated into RGBA
(red, green, blue, alpha) form, and treated as four eight bit bands. <p>

<h2>Georeferencing</h2>

Most GeoTIFF projections should be supported, with the caveat that in order
to translate uncommon Projected, and Geographic coordinate systems into 
OGC WKT it is necessary to have the EPSG .csv files avalable.  They must
be found at the location pointed to by the GEOTIFF_CSV environment variable.
<p>

Georeferencing from GeoTIFF is supported in the form of one tiepoint and
pixel size, a transformation matrix, or a list of GCPs.<p>

If no georeferencing
information is available in the TIFF file itself, GDAL will also check for,
and use an ESRI <a href="frmt_various.html#WLD">world file</a> with the
extention .tfw, .tiffw or .wld, as well as a MapInfo .tab file (only control
points used, Coordsys ignored).<P>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

GeoTIFF files can be created with any GDAL defined band type, including
the complex types.  Created files may have any number of bands.  Files 
with exactly 3 bands will be
given a photometric interpretation of RGB, files with exactly four bands
will have a photometric interpretation of RGBA, while all other combinations 
will have a photometric interpretation of MIN_IS_WHITE.  Files with
pseudo-color tables, or GCPs can currently only be created when creating from 
an existing GDAL dataset with those objects (GDALDriver::CreateCopy()).<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>TFW=YES</b>: Force the generation of an associated ESRI world
file (.tfw).See a <a href="frmt_various.html#WLD">World Files</a> section
for details.<p>

<li> <b>INTERLEAVE=[BAND,PIXEL]</b>: By default TIFF files with band
interleaving (PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE in TIFF terminology) are created.  These
are slightly more efficient for some purposes, but some applications only 
support pixel interleaved TIFF files.  In these cases pass INTERLEAVE=PIXEL
to produce pixel interleaved TIFF files (PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG in TIFF
terminology).<p>

<li> <b>TILED=YES</b>: By default stripped TIFF files are created.  This
option can be used to force creation of tiled TIFF files.<p>

<li> <b>BLOCKXSIZE=n</b>: Sets tile width, defaults to 256.<p>

<li> <b>BLOCKYSIZE=n</b>: Set tile or strip height.  Tile height defaults to
256, strip height defaults to a value such that one strip is 8K or less. <p>

<li> <b>COMPRESS=[JPEG/LZW/PACKBITS/DEFLATE/NONE]</b>: Set the compression
to use.  JPEG should only be used with Byte data.  None is the default.<p>

<li> <b>PREDICTOR=[1/2/3]</b>: Set the predictor for LZW or DEFLATE compression. The default is 1 (no predictor), 2 is horizontal differencing and 3 is floating point prediction.<p>

<li> <b>JPEG_QUALITY=[1-100]</b>:  Set the JPEG quality when using JPEG compression.  A value of 100 is best quality (least compression), and 1 is worst quality (best compression).  The default is 75.<p>

<li> <b>PROFILE=[GDALGeoTIFF/GeoTIFF/BASELINE]</b>: Control what non-baseline
tags are emitted by GDAL.  With <tt>GDALGeoTIFF</tt> (the default) various 
GDAL custom tags may be written.  With <tt>GeoTIFF</tt> only GeoTIFF tags
will be added to the baseline.  With <tt>BASELINE</tt> no GDAL or GeoTIFF
tags will be written.  BASELINE is occationally useful when writing files to
be read by applications intolerant of unrecognised tags.<p>

<li>
<b>PHOTOMETRIC=[MINISBLACK/MINISWHITE/RGB/CMYK/YCBCR/CIELAB/ICCLAB/ITULAB]</b>: 
Set the photometric interpretation tag. Default is MINISBLACK, but if the
input image has 3 or 4 bands of Byte type, then RGB will be selected. You can
override default photometric using this option.<p>

<li> <b>ALPHA=YES</b>: The first "extrasample" is marked as being alpha if
there are any extra samples.  This is necessary if you want to produce
a greyscale TIFF file with an alpha band (for instance). <p>

</ul>

GeoTIFF supports internal creation of overviews (with gdaladdo for instance).
