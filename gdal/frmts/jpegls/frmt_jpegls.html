<h1>JPEGLS</h1>

<p>(GDAL >= 1.8.0)</p>

<p>This driver is an implementation of a JPEG-LS reader/writer based on the Open Source CharLS library (BSD style license).
At the time of writing, the CharLS library in its 1.0 version has no "make install" target. Consequently, the integration of the driver in the
GDAL build system is a big rough. On Unix, you have to edit the GDALmake.opt file and edit the lines related to CHARLS.</p>

<p>The driver can read and write lossless or near-lossless images. Note that it is not aimed at dealing with too big images (unless
enough virtual memory is available), since the whole image must be compressed/decompressed in a single operation.<p>

<h2>Creation Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><b>INTERLEAVE=PIXEL/LINE/BAND</b> : Data interleaving in compressed stream. Default to BAND.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LOSS_FACTOR=error_threshold</b> : 0 (the default) means loss-less compression. Any higher value will be the maximum bound for the error.</li>
</ul>
