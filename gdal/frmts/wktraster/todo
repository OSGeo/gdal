TODO List :

1.- TODO tasks

----- wktrasterdataset.cpp
	- Allow non-regular blocking table arrangements (in general)
  	- Allow PQ connection string parameters in any order
    - Update data blocks in SetProjection
    - Update data blocks in SetGeoTransform
    - Disable sequential scanning in OpenConnection in the database instance
      has support for GEOMETRY type (is a good idea?)
   	- In SetRasterProperties, if we can't create OGRGeometry from database, we 
   	  should "attack" directly the WKT representation of geometry, not abort
      the program. For example, when pszProjectionRef is NULL (SRID = -1), when 
      poSR or prGeom are NULL...
    
    Low priority:  
   	- Add support for rotated images in SetRasterProperties      
    - Check if the tiles of a table REALLY have regular blocking arrangement. 
      The fact that "regular_blocking" field in RASTER_COLUMNS table is set
      to TRUE doesn't proof it. Method TableHasRegularBlocking.


----- wktrasterrasterband.cpp
	- Block caching, to avoid fetching the whole raster from database each time
      IReadBlock is called.
    - Read outdb rasters. Take into account that the outdb raster may don't have
      the same block structure...
    - Update raster_columns table if values read from IReadBlock are different

----- wktrasterwrapper.cpp

	** WKTRasterWrapper class
	- Check assertions that sometimes fail (in several places of the code):
	  CPLAssert(nTransformedBytes == nLengthByWkbString)
	- Check that there is enough data in buffer (method Initialize)
	- FIXME: dfNoDataValue is a double. Doesn't make sense to fetch less than 8 bytes
      if 1 byte, should be put into a Byte and then casted to a double,
      if 2 bytes, should be put into a Int16/UInt16 and then casted to a double, etc...
	- Modify GetWktExtent method to accept non-regular blocking

	** WKTRasterWrapperBand class
	- Allow changing the size of the nodatavalue, that implies modify the
 	  allocated memory for HexWkb representation of the WKT Raster. Now, you
 	  only can change the value, not the size.
