Standalone GRASS Drivers for GDAL and OGR
=========================================

This package contains standalone drivers for GRASS raster and vector
files that can be built after GDAL has been built and installed as an 
"autoload" driver.  

This is particularly useful in resolving problems with GRASS depending
on GDAL, but GDAL with GRASS support depending on GRASS.  With this 
package you can configure and install GDAL normally (--without-grass), then
build and install GRASS normally and finally build and install this driver.

To build this driver it is necessary for it to find GDAL and GRASS support
files.  Typically the configure and build process would look something like:

./configure --with-gdal=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-7.0.0
make
sudo make install

Question:

I am trying to install gdal-grass 1.3.1 on Red hat enterprise linux
advanced server 3.0. I have previously installed gdal 1.3.1 without-
grass, and Grass 6.0.1 with-gdal. I have tried to configure gdal-grass
with:

./configure --with-gdal=/usr/local/gdal/bin/gdal-config --with-
grass=/usr/local/grass-6.0.1

It seems to find gdal alright, but then balks at the Grass location. The
Grass location specified above is indeed the correct location. I have
also tried adding --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.0.1/lib, but with no
success. My error is:

...
checking for G_asprintf in -lgrass_gis ... no
configure: error: --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.0.1 requested, but
libraries not found?


Answer:

Your problem is likely to be solved by editing /etc/ld.so.conf to 
include the locations of proj, gdal, grass, and geos. Specifically, 
the full path to both gdal-config and geos-config, and the full paths 
to the library locations of proj (often /usr/local/lib) and grass (/
usr/local/grass-6.0.1/lib). After editing ld.so.conf, run ldconfig, 
and you should be good to go.

I ran into this problem this weekend (and posted for help to this 
list), so it seems to be a pretty common issue.
