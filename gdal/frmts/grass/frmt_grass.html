<h1>GRASS Raster Format</h1>

GDAL optionally supports reading of existing GRASS raster maps or
imagery groups, but not writing or export. The support for GRASS
raster format is determined when the library is configured, and
requires libgrass to be pre-installed (see Notes below).

<p>
GRASS raster maps/imagery groups can be selected in several ways.

<ol>
<li> The full path to the <tt>cellhd</tt> file can be specified. This
is not a relative path, or at least it must contain all the path
components within the GRASS database including the database root
itself. The following example opens the raster map &quot;proj_tm&quot;
within the GRASS mapset &quot;PERMANENT&quot; of the GRASS location
&quot;proj_tm&quot; in the GRASS database located at
<tt>/u/data/grassdb</tt>.

<p>
For example:

<pre>
gdalinfo /u/data/grassdb/proj_tm/PERMANENT/cellhd/proj_tm
</pre>

<li> The full path to the directory containing information about an
imagery group (or the REF file within it) can be specified to refer to
the whole group as a single dataset.  The following examples do the
same thing.

<p>
For example:

<pre>
gdalinfo /usr2/data/grassdb/imagery/raw/group/testmff/REF
gdalinfo /usr2/data/grassdb/imagery/raw/group/testmff
</pre>

<li> If there is a correct <tt>.grassrc5</tt> (GRASS
5), <tt>.grassrc6</tt> (GRASS 6) <tt>.grass7/rc</tt> (GRASS 7) setup
file in the users home directory then raster maps or imagery groups
may be opened just by the cell name. This only works for raster maps
or imagery groups in the current GRASS location and mapset as defined
in the GRASS setup file.
</ol>

<p>
The following features are supported by the GDAL/GRASS link.

<ul>
<li> Up to 256 entries from raster colormaps are read (0-255).  
<li> Compressed and uncompressed integer (CELL), floating point
(FCELL) and double precision (DCELL) raster maps are all
supported. Integer raster maps are classified with a band type of
&quot;Byte&quot; if the 1-byte per pixel format is used, or
&quot;UInt16&quot; if the two byte per pixel format is used. Otherwise
integer raster maps are treated as &quot;UInt32&quot;.
<li> Georeferencing information is properly read from GRASS format.
<li> An attempt is made to translate coordinate systems, but some
conversions may be flawed, in particular in handling of datums and
units.
</ul>

<h2>Notes on driver variations</h2>

For GRASS 5.7 Radim Blazek has moved the driver to using the GRASS
shared libraries directly instead of using libgrass.  Currently (GDAL
1.2.2 and later) both version of the driver are available and can be
configured using &quot;--with-libgrass&quot; for the libgrass variant
or &quot;--with-grass=&lt;dir&gt;&quot; for the new GRASS 5.7+ library
based version. The GRASS 5.7+ driver version is currently not
supporting coordinate system access, though it is hoped that will be
corrected at some point.
