<h1>SAFE -- Sentinel SAFE XML Product</h1>

<p>Driver for Sentinel products. 
    Currently supports only Sentinel-1 SAR products.</p>

<p>SENTINEL data products are distributed using a SENTINEL-specific variation of 
the Standard Archive Format for Europe (SAFE) format specification. 
The SAFE format has been designed to act as a common format for archiving 
and conveying data within ESA Earth Observation archiving facilities. </p>

<p>The SAFE driver will be used if the manifest.safe or
the containing directory is selected, and it can treat all the imagery as 
one consistent dataset.</p>

<p>The SAFE driver also reads geolocation grid points from the metadata
and represents them as GCPs on the dataset. <p>

<p>ESA will be distributing other satellite datasets in this format; 
however, at this time this driver only supports specific Sentinel-1 SAR products.  
All other will be ignored, or result in various runtime errors.</p>

<h2>Multiple measurements</h2>
<p>If the product contains multiple measurements (for example multiple 
polarizations), each one is available as a raster band</p>


<h2>Data Calibration</h2>
<p>Currently the driver does not apply calibration information.</p>
