<h1>MFF2 -- Vexcel MFF2 Image</h1>
GDAL supports MFF2 Image raster file format for read, update, and creation.
The MFF2 (Multi-File Format 2) format was designed to fit into 
Vexcel Hierarchical Key-Value (HKV) databases, which can store 
binary data as well as ASCII parameters. 
This format is primarily used internally to the Vexcel InSAR
processing system.<p>

To select an MFF2 dataset, select the directory containing the <tt>attrib</tt>, 
and <tt>image_data</tt> files for the dataset.<p>

Currently only latitude/longitude and UTM projection are supported 
(georef.projection.name = ll or georef.projection.name = utm),
with the affine transform computed from the lat/long control points.   In
any event, if GCPs are available in a georef file, they are returned with 
the dataset.<p>

Newly created files (with a type of <tt>MFF2</tt>) are always just raw rasters
with no georeferencing information.  For read, and creation all data types
(real, integer and complex in bit depths of 8, 16, 32) should be supported. <p>

IMPORTANT: When creating a new MFF2, be sure to set the projection before setting the geotransform (this is necessary because the geotransform is stored internally as 5 latitude-longitude ground control points, and the projection is needed to do the conversion).<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/hkvdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2>Format Details</h2>

<h3>MFF2 Top-level Structure</h3>

An MFF2 "file" is actually a set of files stored in a directory 
containing an ASCII header file entitled "attrib", and binary 
image data entitled "image_data".  Optionally, there may be 
an ASCII "georef" file containing georeferencing and projection 
information, and an "image_data_ovr" (for "image_data" binary image data)
file containing tiled overviews of the image in TIFF format.
The ASCII files are arranged in key=value pairs. The allowable 
pairs for each file are described below.


<h3>The "attrib" File</h3>

As a minimum, the "attrib" file must specify the image extents,
pixel size in bytes, pixel encoding and datatype, and pixel
byte order.  For example,

<pre>
extent.cols    = 800
extent.rows    = 1040
pixel.size     = 32
pixel.encoding = { unsigned twos_complement *ieee_754 }
pixel.field    = { *real complex }
pixel.order    = { lsbf *msbf }
version        = 1.1
</pre>

specifies an image that is 1040 lines by 800 pixels in extent.  The
pixels are 32 bits of real data in "most significant byte first" (msbf)
order, encoded according to the ieee_754 specification.  In MFF2, when
a value must belong to a certain subset (eg. pixel.order must be either 
lsbf or msbf), all options are displayed between curly brackets, and
the one appropriate for the current file is indicated with a "*".
<p>
The file may also contain the following lines indicating the number of
channels of data, and how they are interleaved within the binary data
file.

<pre>
channel.enumeration = 1
channel.interleave = { *pixel tile sequential }
</pre>

<h3>The "image_data" File</h3>

The "image_data" file consists of raw binary data, with extents,
pixel encoding, and number of channels as indicated in the "attrib" file.

<h3>The "georef" File</h3>

The "georef" file is used to describe the geocoding and projection
information for the binary data.  For example,

<pre>
top_left.latitude            = 32.93333333333334
top_left.longitude           = 130.0
top_right.latitude           = 32.93333333333334
top_right.longitude          = 130.5
bottom_left.latitude         = 32.50000000000001
bottom_left.longitude        = 130.0
bottom_right.latitude        = 32.50000000000001
bottom_right.longitude       = 130.5
centre.latitude              = 32.71666666666668
centre.longitude             = 130.25
projection.origin_longitude  = 0
projection.name              = ll
spheroid.name                = wgs-84

</pre>

describes an orthogonal latitude/longitude (ll) projected image, with
latitudes and longitudes based on the wgs-84 ellipsoid.
<p>
Since MFF2 version 1.1,
top_left refers to the top left corner of the top left pixel.
top_right refers to the top right corner of the top right pixel.
bottom_left refers to the bottom left corner of the bottom left pixel.
bottom_right refers to the bottom right corner of the bottom right pixel.
centre refers to the centre of the four corners defined above (center
of the image).
<p>
Mathematically, for an Npix by Nline image, the corners and centre in
(pixel,line) coordinates for MFF2 version 1.1 are:

<pre>
top_left: (0,0)
top_right: (Npix,0)
bottom_left: (0,Nline)
bottom_right: (Npix,Nline)
centre: (Npix/2.0,Nline/2.0)
</pre>

These calculations are done using floating point arithmetic (ie.
centre coordinates may take on non-integer values).
<p>
Note that the corners are always expressed in latitudes/longitudes, even 
for projected images.
<p>

<h3>Supported projections</h3>

ll- Orthogonal latitude/longitude projected image, with latitude
parallel to the rows, longitude parallel to the columns. Parameters:
spheroid name, projection.origin_longitude (longitude at the origin of
the projection coordinates).  If not set, this should default to the 
central longitude of the output image based on its projection boundaries.
<p>
utm- Universal Transverse Mercator projected image.  Parameters:
spheroid name, projection.origin_longitude (central meridian for the
utm projection).  The central meridian must be the  meridian at the 
centre of a UTM zone, ie. 3 degrees, 9 degrees, 12 degrees, etc.  If 
this is not specified or set a valid UTM central meridian, the reader 
should reset the value to the nearest valid central meridian based on 
the central longitude of the output image.  The latitude at the origin 
of the UTM projection is always 0 degrees.
<p>
