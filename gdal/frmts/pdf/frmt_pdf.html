<h1>Geospatial PDF</h1>

(Available for GDAL &gt;= 1.8.0)
<p>
GDAL supports reading Geospatial PDF documents, by extracting georeferencing information and rasterizing the data.
Non-geospatial PDF documents will also be recognized by the driver.
<p>
Starting with GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0, PDF documents can be created from other GDAL raster datasets, and OGR datasources can
also optionally be drawn on top of the raster layer (see OGR_* creation options in the below section).
<p>
GDAL must be compiled with libpoppler support (GPL-licensed), and libpoppler itself must have been configured with
--enable-xpdf-headers so that the xpdf C++ headers are available. Note: the poppler C++ API isn't
stable, so the driver compilation may fail with too old or too recent poppler versions.
Successfully tested versions are poppler &gt;= 0.12.X and &lt;= 0.26.0.
<p>
Starting with GDAL 1.9.0, as an alternative, the PDF driver can be compiled against libpodofo (LGPL-licensed)
to avoid the libpoppler dependency. This is sufficient to get the georeferencing and vector information. However, for
getting the imagery, the pdftoppm utility that comes with the poppler distribution must be available in the system PATH.
A temporary file will be generated in a directory determined by the following configuration options : CPL_TMPDIR,
TMPDIR or TEMP (in that order). If none are defined, the current directory will be used.
Successfully tested versions are libpodofo 0.8.4 and 0.9.1.
<p>
The driver supports reading georeferencing encoded in either of the 2 current existing ways : according to the OGC
encoding best practice, or according to the Adobe Supplement to ISO 32000.
<p>
Multipage documents are exposed as subdatasets, one subdataset par page of the document.
<p>
The neatline (for OGC best practice) or the bounding box (Adobe style) will be reported as a NEATLINE metadata item,
so that it can be later used as a cutline for the warping algorithm.
<p>
Starting with GDAL 1.9.0, XMP metadata can be extracted from the file, and will be
stored as XML raw content in the xml:XMP metadata domain.
<p>
Starting with GDAL 1.10.0, additional metadata, such as found in USGS Topo PDF can be extracted from the file, and will be
stored as XML raw content in the EMBEDDED_METADATA metadata domain.
<p>

<h2>Vector support</h2>

<p>
Starting with GDAL 1.10, this driver can read and write geospatial PDF with vector features.
Vector read support requires linking to podofo or poppler libraries, but write support does not.

The driver can read vector features encoded according to PDF's logical structure facilities (as described by "§10.6 - Logical Structure" of PDF spec),
or retrieve only vector geometries for other vector PDF files.<p>

<h2>Feature style support</h2>

For write support, the driver has partial support for the style information attached to features,
encoded according to the <a href="ogr_feature_style.html">OGR Feature Style Specification</a>.<p>

The following tools are recognized :
<ul>
<li>For points, LABEL and SYMBOL.</li>
<li>For lines, PEN.</li>
<li>For polygons, PEN and BRUSH.</li>
</ul>

The supported attributes for each tool are summed up in the following table :<p>

<table border="1">

<tr>
<th>Tool</th>
<th>Supported attributes</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>

<tr><td>PEN</td><td>color, width and dash pattern</td><td>PEN(c:#FF0000,w:5px)</td></tr>
<tr><td>BRUSH</td><td>foreground color</td><td>BRUSH(fc:#0000FF)</td></tr>
<tr><td>LABEL</td><td>text (limited to ASCII strings), foreground color, size, x and y offsets, and angle</td><td>LABEL(c:#000000,t:"Hello World!",s:5)</td></tr>
<tr><td>SYMBOL</td><td>id (ogr-sym-0 to ogr-sym-9, and filenames for raster symbols), color and size</td>
<td>SYMBOL(c:#00FF00,id:"ogr-sym-3",s:10)<br>SYMBOL(c:#00000080,id:"a_symbol.png")</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Alpha values are supported for colors to control the opacity. If not specified, for BRUSH, it is set at 50% opaque.<p>

For SYMBOL with a bitmap name, only the alpha value of the color specified with 'c' is taken into account.<p>

<h2>Configuration options</h2>

<ul>
<li><i>GDAL_PDF_DPI</i> : To control the dimensions of the raster by specifying the DPI of the
rasterization with the Its default value is 150. Starting with GDAL 1.10, the driver
will make some effort to guess the DPI value either from a specific metadata item contained in some PDF files, or
from the raster images inside the PDF (in simple cases).</li>
<li><i>GDAL_PDF_NEATLINE</i> : (GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0 ) The name of the neatline to select (only available for geospatial PDF, encoded
according to OGC Best Practice). This defaults to "Map Layers" for USGS Topo PDF. If not found, the neatline that
covers the largest area.</li>

<p>
Starting with GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0 and when GDAL is compiled against libpoppler, the following options are also
available :

<li><i>GDAL_PDF_RENDERING_OPTIONS</i> : a combination of VECTOR, RASTER and TEXT separated
by comma, to select whether vector, raster or text features should be rendered. If the option is not
specified, all features are rendered.</li>
<li><i>GDAL_PDF_BANDS</i> = 3 or 4 : whether the PDF should be rendered as a RGB (3) or RGBA (4) image.
Defaults to 3.</li>
<li><i>GDAL_PDF_LAYERS</i> = list of layers (comma separated) to turn ON (or "ALL" to turn all layers ON).
The layer names can be obtained by querying the LAYERS metadata domain. When this option is specified,
layers not explicitely listed will be turned off.</li>
<li><i>GDAL_PDF_LAYERS_OFF</i> = list of layers (comma separated) to turn OFF. The layer names can be obtained by
querying the LAYERS metadata domain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LAYERS Metadata domain</h2>

Starting with GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0 and when GDAL is compiled against libpoppler, the LAYERS metadata domain can be queried
to retrieve layer names that can be turned ON or OFF. This is usefull to know which values to specify for the
<i>GDAL_PDF_LAYERS</i> or <i>GDAL_PDF_LAYERS_OFF</i> configuration options.<p>

For example :
<pre>
$ gdalinfo ../autotest/gdrivers/data/adobe_style_geospatial.pdf -mdd LAYERS

Driver: PDF/Geospatial PDF
Files: ../autotest/gdrivers/data/adobe_style_geospatial.pdf
[...]
Metadata (LAYERS):
  LAYER_00_NAME=New_Data_Frame
  LAYER_01_NAME=New_Data_Frame.Graticule
  LAYER_02_NAME=Layers
  LAYER_03_NAME=Layers.Measured_Grid
  LAYER_04_NAME=Layers.Graticule
[...]

$ gdal_translate ../autotest/gdrivers/data/adobe_style_geospatial.pdf out.tif --config GDAL_PDF_LAYERS_OFF "New_Data_Frame"

</pre>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

The opening of a PDF document (to get the georeferencing) is fast, but at the first access to a raster block,
the whole page will be rasterized, which can be a slow operation.
<p>
Note: starting with GDAL 1.10, some raster-only PDF files (such as some USGS GeoPDF files), that are regularly
tiled are exposed as tiled dataset by the GDAL PDF driver, and can be rendered with either the Poppler or the
Podofo backends.
<p>
Only a few of the possible Datums available in the OGC best practice spec have been currently mapped
in the driver. Unrecognized datums will be considered as being based on the WGS84 ellipsoid.
<p>
For documents that contain several neatlines in a page (insets), the georeferencing will be
extracted from the inset that has the largest area (in term of screen points).
<p>

<h2>Creation Issues (GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0)</h2>

<p>PDF documents can be created from other GDAL raster datasets, that
have 1 band (graylevel or with color table), 3 bands (RGB) or 4 bands (RGBA).</p>

<p>Georeferencing information will be written by default according to
the ISO32000 specification. It is also possible to write it according to the
OGC Best Practice conventions (but limited to a few datum and projection types).</p>

<p>Note: PDF write support does not require linking to poppler or podofo.</p>

<h3>Creation Options</h3>

data will be copied to the output PDF, unless this option is set to NONE. The XMP
xml string can also be directly set to this option.</p></li>

<li><p><b>WRITE_INFO=[YES/NO]</b>:
By default, the AUTHOR, CREATOR, CREATION_DATE, KEYWORDS, PRODUCER, SUBJECT and TITLE information

If this option is set to NO, no information will be written.</p></li>

<li><p><b>AUTHOR</b>, <b>CREATOR</b>, <b>CREATION_DATE</b>, <b>KEYWORDS</b>, <b>PRODUCER</b>,
    <b>SUBJECT</b>, <b>TITLE</b> : metadata that can be written into the PDF Info block.
Note: the format of the value for CREATION_DATE must be D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm'
(e.g. D:20121122132447+02'00' for 22 nov 2012 13:24:47 GMT+02)
(see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf">PDF Reference, version 1.7</a>, page 160) </p></li>

<li><p><b>OGR_DATASOURCE=name</b> : Name of the OGR datasource to display on top of the raster layer.</p></li>

<li><p><b>OGR_DISPLAY_FIELD=name</b> : Name of the field (matching the name of a field from the OGR layer definition)
to use to build the label of features that appear in the "Model Tree" UI component of a well-known PDF viewer.
For example, if the OGR layer has a field called "ID", this can be used as the value for that option : features
in the "Model Tree" will be labelled from their value for the "ID" field.
If not specified, sequential generic labels will be used ("feature1", "feature2", etc... ).</p></li>

<li><p><b>OGR_DISPLAY_LAYER_NAMES=names</b> : Comma separated list of names to display for the OGR layers in the "Model Tree".
This option is useful to provide custom names, instead of OGR layer name that are used when this option is not specified.
When specified, the number of names should be the same as the number of OGR layers in the datasource (and in the order they appear when
listed by ogrinfo for example). </p></li>

<h2>Update of existing files (GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0)</h2>

Existing PDF files (created or not with GDAL) can be opened in update mode in order to set or
update the following elements :
<ul>
    <li>Geotransform and associated projection (with SetGeoTransform() and SetProjection()) </li>
    <li>GCPs (with SetGCPs())</li>
    <li>Neatline (with SetMetadataItem("NEATLINE", polygon_definition_in_wkt))</li>
    <li>Content of Info object (with SetMetadataItem(key, value) where key is one of AUTHOR, CREATOR, CREATION_DATE, KEYWORDS, PRODUCER, SUBJECT and TITLE)</li>
    <li>xml:XMP metadata (with SetMetadata(md, "xml:XMP"))</li>
</ul>

For geotransform or GCPs, the Geo encoding method used by default is ISO32000. OGC_BP can be
selected by setting the GDAL_PDF_GEO_ENCODING configuration option to OGC_BP.<p>

Updated elements are written at the end of the file, following the incremental update method described in
the PDF specification.<p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Create a PDF from 2 rasters (main_raster and another_raster), such that main_raster is initially displayed, and they are exclusively displayed :
<pre>
gdal_translate -of PDF main_raster.tif my.pdf -co LAYER_NAME=main_raster
               -co EXTRA_RASTERS=another_raster.tif -co EXTRA_RASTERS_LAYER_NAME=another_raster

</pre>
</li>

<li>
Create of PDF with some JavaScript :
<pre>
gdal_translate -of PDF my.tif my.pdf -co JAVASCRIPT_FILE=script.js
</pre>

where script.js is :
<pre>
button = app.alert({cMsg: 'This file was generated by GDAL. Do you want to visit its website ?', cTitle: 'Question', nIcon:2, nType:2});
if (button == 4) app.launchURL('http://gdal.org/');
