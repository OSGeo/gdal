<h1>WCS -- OGC Web Coverage Service</h1>

The optional GDAL WCS driver allows use of a coverage in a WCS server as a
raster dataset.  GDAL acts as a client to the WCS server.<p>

Accessing a WCS server is accomplished by creating a local service
description file that contains one <tt>&lt;WCS_GDAL&gt;</tt> XML
element.  It is important that there is no spaces or other content
outside that element. Starting at version 2.3 the service description
file is meant to be managed by the driver in a cache directory. User
can control the contents of the service file using options.<p>

The dataset name is either the service description file or (starting
at version 2.3) <tt>"WCS:&lt;URL&gt;"</tt>, where the &lt;URL&gt; is
the URL of the server potentially appended with version, coverage, and
extra parameter strings. In that case the service description file is
managed by the driver in a cache directory along with GDAL metadata
files and servers' capability responses and coverage descriptions.<p>

In the case of initial use of the "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;" dataset name
without a coverage name, the driver attempts to fetch the capabilities
document from the server, save it to the cache, parse it, create
metadata describing the service and coverage offering, save that to
the cache (same key is used), and show it to the user. Coverages are
recorded as subdatasets. Subsequent use of the driver using the "WCS:"
format will reuse the metadata obtained from the Capabilities file
unless asked to refresh or recreate. Note that the version string is a
part of the key that is used to match capabilities to coverage
descriptions.<p>

If the URL in the "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;" dataset name contains a coverage
name key value pair, the driver creates an initial service description
file into the cache. If a matching capabilities document is not found,
it will be fetched first.<p>

Despite how the service description file was obtained, when it is
first used, GDAL will fetch the coverage description, and a small test
image to establish details about the raster.  This information will be
cached in the service description file to make future opens faster -
no server access should be required till imagery is read for future
opens.<p>

However, with service version 2.0.1 (for which support is available
starting at GDAL version 2.3), it may be that the coverage has more
than two dimensions. In that case, the driver will append the coverage
metadata and show zero bands. At that point, the user must use options
to further instruct the driver how to deal with extra dimensions and
data fields.<p>

The WCS driver supports WCS versions 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and
2.0.1 at basic level (version 0.7 is not supported). Any return format
that is a single file, and is in a format supported by GDAL should
work. The driver will prefer a format with "tiff" in the name,
otherwise it will fallback to the first offered format. However, the
user may set the preferred format. Coordinate systems are read from
the DescribeCoverage result, and are expected to be in the form of
<tt>EPSG:n</tt> in the <tt>&lt;supportedCRSs&gt;</tt> element.<p>

The service description file has the following additional elements as
immediate children of the <tt>WCS_GDAL</tt> element that may be
optionally set. When the "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;" format dataset name is
used, the contents of the service description file is meant to be
modified by using options.<p>

<ul>
<li> <b>PreferredFormat</b>: The format to use for GetCoverage calls.

<li> <b>Interpolation</b>: The interpolation method used when scaling
(requires WCS version 2.0.1).

<li> <b>BandCount</b>: Number of bands in the dataset, normally
captured from the sample request.

<li> <b>BandType</b>: The pixel data type to use.  Normally
established from the sample request.

<li> <b>BlockXSize</b>: The block width to use for block cached remote
access.

<li> <b>BlockYSize</b>: The block height to use for block cached
remote access.

<li> <b>NoDataValue</b>: The nodata value to use for all the bands
(blank for none). Normally defaulted from CoverageOffering info. In
WCS version 2.0.1 this may be a comma separated list of values, one
for each band.

<li> <b>Timeout</b>: The timeout to use for remote service requests.
If not provided, the libcurl default is used.

<li> <b>UserPwd</b>: May be supplied with <i>userid:password</i> to
pass a userid and password to the remote server.

<li> <b>HttpAuth</b>: May be BASIC, NTLM or ANY to control the
authentication scheme to be used.

<li> <b>OverviewCount</b>: The number of overviews to represent bands
as having.  Defaults to a number such that the top overview is fairly
smaller (less than 1K x 1K or so).

<li> <b>GetCoverageExtra</b>: An additional set of keywords to add to
GetCoverage requests in URL encoded form.
eg. "&RESAMPLE=BILINEAR&Band=1"

<li> <b>DescribeCoverageExtra</b>: An additional set of keywords to
add to DescribeCoverage requests in URL encoded form.
eg. "&CustNo=775"

<li> <b>Version</b>: Set a specific WCS version to use.  Currently
defaults to 1.0.0 or to the server default (if WCS: name format is
used) and 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 2.0.1 are also supported.

<li> <b>FieldName</b>: Name of the field being accessed.  Used only
with WCS 1.1.0+.  Defaults to the first field in the DescribeCoverage
result. Format (in 2.0.1) <i>field_name,field_name:field_name,..</i>

<li> <b>Domain</b>: The axes that are used for the spatial
dimensions. The default is to use the first two axes given by the
server. The axis order swap may apply. Format:
<i>axis_name,axis_name</i> A <i>field_name:field_name</i> in the list
denotes a range of fields. (Requires WCS 2.0.1)</li>

<li><b>Dimensions</b>: Trim or slice a dimension when fetching data
from the server. Format:
<i>axis_name(trim_begin_value,trim_end_value);axis_name(slice_value)</i>
(Requires WCS 2.0.1)</li>

<li><b>DimensionToBand</b>: Map the given dimension, for example
'time', into bands. Format: <i>axis_name</i> (Requires WCS 2.0.1)</li>

<li> <b>DefaultTime</b>: A timePosition to use by default when
accessing coverages with a time dimension.  Populated with the last
offered time position by default. (Only for version 1.0.0)<p>

<li> <b>Elements that may be needed to deal with server quirks</b>

<li><b>OriginNotCenter100</b>: Set to consider WCS version 1.0.0 grid
origin to be at the pixel boundary instead of the pixel center. (Use
for MapServer versions <= 7.0.6)</li>

<li><b>OuterExtents</b>: Set to consider WCS 1.1 extents as boundaries
or outer pixels instead of centers of outer pixels. (Use for
GeoServer).</li>

<li><b>BufSizeAdjust</b>: Set to 0.5 in WCS 1.1 if data access fails
due to the response not having expected size. (Use for
GeoServer).</li>

<li><b>OffsetsPositive</b>: Use with MapServer in WCS version
2.0.1. together wwith NrOffsets.

<li><b>NrOffsets</b>: Set to 2 if the server requires that there are
only two values in the GridOffsets.  Use when the server is MapServer
or ArcGIS. With MapServer use also OffsetsPositive.

<li><b>GridCRSOptional</b>: Let the driver skip Grid* parameters from
a WCS 1.1 GetCoverage request if the request is not scaled. Do not use
for GeoServer.</li>

<li><b>NoGridAxisSwap</b>: Set to tell the driver not to swap axis
order. When reading the grid geometry (in WCS 1.1 the origin and
offsets, in WCS 2.0.1 the grid envelope, axis labels, and offsets) no
axis order swap is done although it would otherwise be done if this
flag is set. In 1.1 it would be done if the CRS has inverted axes. In
2.0.1 it would be done if the axisOrder of the sequenceRule in
GridFunction defines so. This is needed usually both in 1.1 and 2.0.1
when parsing coverage descriptions from MapServer and GeoServer.</li>

<li><b>SubsetAxisSwap</b> Set to tell the driver to swap the axis
names in boundedBy.Envelope.axisLabels when making WCS 2.0.1
GetCoverage request. Needed for GeoServer when EPSG dictates axis
order swap.</li>

<li><b>UseScaleFactor</b>: Set to tell the driver to use scale by
factor approach instead of scale to size when making a WCS 2.0.1
GetCoverage request. Required when the server is ArcGIS.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Open options</h3>

When the "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;" dataset name format is used, open options
are used to control the driver and the contents of the service
description file.  In the case the URL does not contain coverage name,
the service description file is not used and thus in that case the
options are not written into it. Open options are given separate to
the dataset name, with GDAL utility programs they are given using the
-oo switch (<tt>-oo "NAME=VALUE"</tt>). The -oo swicth expects only
one option but more options can be given repeating the switch.<p>

In addition to DescribeCoverageExtra and GetCoverageExtra, which are
stored in the service description file, there is also
GetCapabilitiesExtra, which can be used as an open option when requesting
the overall capabilities from the server.

The open option SKIP_GETCOVERAGE can be used to prevent the driver
making a GetCoverage request to the server, which it usually does if
it can't determine the band count and band data type from the
capabilities or coverage descriptions. This option may be needed if
GetCoverage request fails.<p>

All above listed element names can be given as options to the WCS
driver.  In the case of flags the option should formally be
"Name=TRUE", but only "Name" suffices.<p>

<h3>The cache</h3>

When the "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;" dataset name format is used, the server
responses, the service description file, and the metadata files are
stored in a cache. Generally, if the needed resource is in the cache,
it will be used and no extra calls to the server are done.<p>

The cache control options/flags are
<ul>

<li><b>CACHE_DIR=path</b> (The default location of the cache directory is
$HOME/.gdal/wcs_cache)</li>

<li><b>CLEAR_CACHE</b> (The cache is completely initialized and all files are
deleted.)</li>

<li><b>REFRESH_CACHE</b> (The cache entry, either capabilities or coverage,
depending on the call at hand, is deleted.)</li>

<li><b>RECREATE_META</b> (The metadata file (.aux.xml) is recreated,
either the server or the coverage related metadata file depending on
the call at hand.)</li>

<li><b>RECREATE_SERVICE</b> (The service description file is
re-initialized. Note that the service file is always updated with
elements given as options.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The WCS: dataset name format</h3>

The URL in the dataset name is not a complete WCS request URL. The
request URL, specifically, its query part, for GetCapabilities,
DescribeCoverage, and GetCoverage requests is composed by the
driver. Typically the user should only need to add to the server
address the version and coverage parameters. The string 'coverage' can
be used as the coverage parameter key although different WCS versions
use different keys. 'coverage' is also always used in the cache key.<p>

The user may add non-standard extra parameters to the URL. However,
when that is done, it should be noted that the URL is a cache database
key and capability documents are linked to coverage documents through
the key. Please consider using the *Extra open options.<p>

<h3>Time</h3>

Starting with GDAL 1.9.0, this driver includes experimental support
for time based WCS 1.0.0 servers.  On initial access the last offered
time position will be identified as the DefaultTime.  Each time
position available for the coverage will be treated as a
subdataset. <p>

Note that time based subdatasets are not supported when the service description
is the filename.  Currently time support is not available for versions other
than WCS 1.0.0.  <p>
