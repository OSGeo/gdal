<h1>WCS -- OGC Web Coverage Service</h1>

The optional GDAL WCS driver allows use of a coverage in a WCS server as a
raster dataset.  GDAL acts as a client to the WCS server.<p>

Accessing a WCS server is accomplished by creating a local service description
xml file looking something like the following, with the coverage server url,
and the name of the coverage to access.  It is important that there be no
spaces or other content before the <tt>&lt;WCS_GDAL&gt;</tt> element.<p>

<pre>
&lt;WCS_GDAL&gt;
  &lt;ServiceURL&gt;http://laits.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/NWGISS/NWGISS?&lt;/ServiceURL&gt;
  &lt;CoverageName&gt;AUTUMN.hdf&lt;/CoverageName&gt;
&lt;/WCS_GDAL&gt;
</pre>

When first opened, GDAL will fetch the coverage description, and a small test
image to establish details about the raster.  This information will be cached
in the service description file to make future opens faster - no server access
should be required till imagery is read for future opens.<p>

The WCS driver should support WCS 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 servers, but WCS 0.7 servers
are not supported.  Any return format that is a single file, and is in a format
supported by GDAL should work.  The driver will prefer a format with "tiff"
in the name, otherwise
it will fallback to the first offered format.   Coordinate systems are read
from the DescribeCoverage result, and are expected to be in the form of
<tt>EPSG:n</tt> in the <tt>&lt;supportedCRSs&gt;</tt> element. <p>

The service description file has the following additional elements as
immediate children of the <tt>WCS_GDAL</tt> element that may be optionally
set.<p>

<ul>
<li> <b>PreferredFormat</b>: the format to use for GetCoverage calls.<p>
<li> <b>BandCount</b>: Number of bands in the dataset, normally captured from the sample request.
<li> <b>BandType</b>: The pixel data type to use.  Normally established from the sample request.
<li> <b>BlockXSize</b>: The block width to use for block cached remote access.
<li> <b>BlockYSize</b>: The block height to use for block cached remote access.
<li> <b>NoDataValue</b>: The nodata value to use for all the bands (blank for none).  Normally defaulted from CoverageOffering info.
<li> <b>Timeout</b>: The timeout to use for remote service requests.  If not provided, the libcurl default is used.
<li> <b>USERPWD</b>: May be supplied with <i>userid:password</i> to pass a
userid and password to the remote server.
<li> <b>HTTPAUTH</b>: May be BASIC, NTLM or ANY to control the authentication scheme to be used.
<li> <b>OverviewCount</b>: The number of overviews to represent bands as having.  Defaults to a number such that the top overview is fairly smaller (less than 1K x 1K or so).
<li> <b>GetCoverageExtra</b>: An additional set of keywords to add to GetCoverage requests in URL encoded form.  eg. "&RESAMPLE=BILINEAR&Band=1"
<li> <b>DescribeCoverageExtra</b>: An additional set of keywords to add to DescribeCoverage requests in URL encoded form.  eg. "&CustNo=775"
<li> <b>Version</b>:  Set a specific WCS version to use.  Currently defaults to 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 is also supported.
<li> <b>FieldName</b>: Name of the field being accessed.  Used only with WCS 1.1.0+.  Defaults to the first field in the DescribeCoverage result.
<li> <b>DefaultTime</b>: A timePosition to use by default when accessing
coverages with a time dimension.  Populated with the last offered time
position by default.
</ul>

<h3>"WCS:" format for dataset name, caching, and version 2.0.1 servers</h3>

<p>
  Starting with GDAL 2.3.0, this driver supports "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;"
  format for the WCS dataset name. When using this format the WCS_GDAL
  XML service files are not meant to be written by the user. The
  driver will maintain a cache for the Capabilities, (PAM) metadata,
  coverage description, and service files. Also starting with GDAL
  2.3.0 the driver includes support for version 2.0.1 servers.
</p>

<p>
  The supposed workflow of the driver is as follows (an example with
  gdalinfo). At each step the command
  <pre>gdalinfo -oo &lt;option=value&gt; "WCS:&lt;URL&gt;"</pre>
  is given with varying options and URL.
  At each point the HTTP options
  <ul>
    <li>TimeOut=value</li>
    <li>USERPWD=value</li>
    <li>HTTPAUTH=value</li>
  </ul>
  the common cache control options
  <ul>
    <li>CACHE_DIR=path (The default location of the cache
      directory is $HOME/.gdal/wcs_cache)</li>
    <li>CLEAR_CACHE=TRUE (The cache is completely initialized and all
      files are deleted.)</li>
    <li>REFRESH_CACHE=TRUE (The cache entry (a URL without parameters,
      or with version and/or coverage parameters) is deleted.)</li>
    <li>RECREATE_META=TRUE (The metadata file (.aux.xml) is recreated,
    either the server, server at a version, or the coverage related
      metadata file.)</li>
    <li>RECREATE_SERVICE=TRUE (The service (WCS_GDAL) XML file is
      initialized. Note that the service file is always updated with
      elements given as options.</li>
  </ul>
  and extra key value pairs for the requests (EXTRA=key1=value1&amp;key2=value2...)
  may be used. More than one option can be given by repeating the -oo switch.
  <ol>
    <li>Initially the URL may be plain URL for the server, but it may
      also contain a request for the server to use a specific version
      (for example "http://example.com/server?version=2.0.1"). The
      driver attempts to fetch the Capabilities file from the server,
      save it to the cache, parse it, create metadata describing the
      server and coverage offering, save that to the cache (same key
      is used), and show it to the user. Coverages are recorded as
      subdatasets.  Subsequent use of the driver using the "WCS:"
      format will reuse the metadata obtained from the Capabilities
      file unless asked to refresh or recreate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the coverage offering of the server is known, a coverage
      name/id can be added to the URL as a parameter (key may be
      'coverageId', 'identifiers', or 'coverage'; the last one is
      always used in the cache key). Given that, the driver attempts
      to fetch the coverage description from the server, save it to
      the cache (a new key is used), parse it, and create a service
      file. At this point, when the version 2.0.1 is used, the driver
      may map the data fields into raster bands. However, if the
      coverage contains more than two dimensions, nothing is yet
      mapped to bands. The user needs to use the Dimensions or the
      DimensionToBand option to either define the value at which the
      extra dimension is sliced or that it is mapped as bands. If the
      DimensionToBand option is selected, it may be necessary to also
      define with the Range option the field that is put as data into
      the bands.
      <ul>
        <li>CRS=value (Override the default CRS used by the
        server. Note: currently not implemented.)</li>
        <li>PreferredFormat=value (Override the default format
        selected by the driver.)</li>
        <li>Domain=axis_name,axis_name (The default is to use the
        first two axes given by the server. The axis order swap may
        apply.)</li>
        <li>Dimensions=axis_name(trim_begin_value,trim_end_value);axis_name(slice_value)
        (Trim or slice a dimension when fetching data from the server.)</li>
        <li>DimensionToBand=axis_name (Map the given dimension, for
          example 'time', into bands.)</li>
        <li>DefaultTime (see DefaultTime above, only for 1.0.0)</li>
        <li>Interpolation=value (One of the server supported
        interpolation methods.)</li>
        <li>FieldName=field_name,field_name:field_name,.. (A list of
        fields to be mapped to bands. A field_name:field_name element
        in the list denotes a range of fields. If not set, defaults to
        the first field in the coverage description in versions
        1.)</li>       
        <li>OverviewCount (see OverviewCount above)</li>
        <li>GetCoverageExtra (see GetCoverageExtra above)</li>
        <li>DescribeCoverageExtra (see DescribeCoverageExtra above)</li>
        <li>BlockXSize (see BlockXSize above)</li>
        <li>BlockYSize (see BlockYSize above)</li>
        <li>NoDataValue=value,value,.. ('no data' values for the fields)</li>
        <li>NoGridSwap=TRUE (The driver will not swap the grid axis order
        even though the GridFunction.sequenceRule.axisOrder appears to
          say so.)</li>
        <li>SubsetAxisSwap=TRUE (The driver will swap the axis names
        given in boundedBy.Envelope.axisLabels for GetCoverage
        request. May be needed for GeoServer when EPSG dictates axis
          order swap.)</li>
        <li>SKIP_GETCOVERAGE=TRUE (The driver will not make a small
        GetCoverage request to the server, which it usually does if it
        does not know the band count and band type but is otherwise
        ok. This may be needed if GetCoverage request fails due to
        reasons mentioned above.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once the service file is such that it specifies bands, it can
    be used for requesting data from the server.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Time</h3>

Starting with GDAL 1.9.0, this driver includes experimental support for time based WCS 1.0.0 servers.
On initial access the last offered time position will be identified as the
DefaultTime.  Each time position available for the coverage will be treated
as a subdataset. <p>

Note that time based subdatasets are not supported when the service description
is the filename.  Currently time support is not available for versions other
than WCS 1.0.0.  <p>
