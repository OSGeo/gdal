Sustainable GDAL Sponsorship Prospectus
================================================================================

Overview
--------

GDAL is one of the most successful open source projects in the world, and its
importance to the entire geospatial industry can't be understated. The vast
majority of software used to make maps or run geospatial analysis relies on GDAL,
usually in a fundamental way. It provides a shared commons that enables everyone
to focus on higher level problems - if GDAL didn't exist then every single
organization would need to write (or buy) much more low level code before they
even started on their unique value proposition. For more about GDAL see this
`great article <https://thenewstack.io/gdal-the-open-source-technology-behind-google-maps/>`__
by Matt Asay from AWS.

One would expect that such a foundational project would have all the resources
it needs, since so many organizations, large and small, rely on it. Unfortunately
that's far from the case, and indeed it's actually close to a breaking point.
A common metric in software projects is the 'bus factor' - defined as
'the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project
before the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel'.
GDAL's bus factor is currently close do 1. And it is clear that the work to maintain
GDAL is more than a single person can handle, and if the current situation continues,
then he will burn out and GDAL will stall.

So it's time for the Geospatial Industry, and indeed anyone who relies on
geospatial technology in any way, to enable GDAL to shift from begging for
scraps to long-term sustainability. We need to pool our resources so that GDAL
not only survives, but thrives.

There have been a number successful 'barn raising' efforts in the past where the
community has come together for particular features and improvements, but each
requires a substantial organization effort and doesn't quite get at the core
sustainability of the project. This time we are aiming for sustained financial
investments to transform GDAL to a truly sustainable project, expanding to a team
of maintainers who don't just 'keep up' but are able to advance GDAL to be faster,
more reliable, more secure, easier to use and just 'better'.

What is Sponsorship For?
------------------------

Sustainable GDAL sponsorship funds are used to support the holistic tasks that
keep the project healthy and the code quality high:

* Performance and efficiency work, to ensure the backbone of data access and
  processing is as fast as possible.
* Code quality and security review, to catch and repair security and reliability
  issues before they become bugs.
* Patch review and comment, to bring contributions up to a high standard, and
  ensure new contributions do not degrade the overall project quality.
* Infrastructure maintenance and modernization, to ensure automated builds and
  tests exist and are run automatically so that the code can evolve quickly,
  with high reliability.
* Community communications and education, to ensure that the users of the
  software know what it can do, and make the best use of it.

We will also be aiming to increase our 'bus factor', by cultivating new
contributors, and enabling them with funding to actively support various
community tasks.

Who Should Sponsor?
-------------------

If your organization:

* Uses GDAL directly, as a tool or a library in your system
* Has customers who use GDAL on your platform, or in their workflows when
  utilizing your products
* Wants to add features to GDAL

Then you have a stake in the ongoing health of the GDAL project, and your organization will benefit from sponsoring. If you use GDAL then you are benefiting from an incredible virtuous cycle, where different organizations fund the improvements they need and the results are available to everyone else. It's a continual cycle of 'pay it forward', leading to the library getting better with every release, benefitting every user.

Sponsorship dollars ensure that there is ongoing development to the core of the GDAL code and infrastructure that keeps the code fast, reliable and ready to contribute to, enabling that virtuous cycle.

Investing in this shared resource together ensures that GDAL remains a solid foundation that you can rely upon, and the pooled funding will enable a continual upgrading of its core capabilities. Everyone who sponsors shares the core maintenance load together, so everyone can benefit as new features and improvements land.

The alternative is a slow devolution and eventual forking into multiple incompatible versions, that will break the virtuous cycle of GDAL community that has brought us so far.

With this round of sponsorship we are aiming for enough money to not just stave off slow devolution, but to accelerate the virtuous cycle by providing enough funds for the core project contributors to tackle the bits that everyone benefits from but no one has yet funded.

    If you are excited to help GDAL but need more help convincing decision-makers in your organization see the document we made on 'The Case for Funding GDAL', and adapt it to your org, and don't hesitate to get in touch with us <link to gdal fundraising committee> for help. We are happy to even get on the phone to help make the case.

What is Sponsorship Not For?
----------------------------

The Sustainable GDAL sponsorship dollars are not designed to be directed towards specific developments of features or bugs by sponsors. The usual mechanisms for that type of work have been quite healthy, and remain in place. These sponsorship funds will be used for global maintenance tasks, as determined by the Project Steering Committee.

Specific feature developments or bug fixes can still be submitted as pull requests, and the existence of maintenance funds will help ensure they are promptly reviewed and incorporated, but again sponsors cannot direct that the funds be used to accept particular submissions.

To direct funds to particular tasks, preferred features or specific bugs, you can still contract with a GDAL service provider to work on your needs, within your timeframes and contractual requirements.
