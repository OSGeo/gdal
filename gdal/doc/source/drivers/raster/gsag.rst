.. shortname:: GSAG

.. built_in_by_default::

This is the ASCII-based (human-readable) version of one of the raster
formats used by Golden Software products (such as the Surfer series).
This format is supported for both reading and writing (including create,
delete, and copy). Currently the associated formats for color, metadata,
and shapes are not supported.

NOTE: Implemented as ``gdal/frmts/gsg/gsagdataset.cpp``.
