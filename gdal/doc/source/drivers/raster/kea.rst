GDAL can read, create and update files in the KEA format, through the libkea library.

KEA is an image file format, named after the New Zealand bird, that
provides a full implementation of the GDAL data model and is implemented
within a HDF5 file. A software library, libkea, is used to access the
file format. The format has comparable performance with existing formats
while producing smaller file sizes and is already within active use for
a number of projects within Landcare Research, New Zealand, and the
wider community.

The KEA format supports the following features of the GDAL data model:

-  Multiple-band support, with possible different datatypes. Bands can
   be added to an existing dataset with AddBand() API
-  Image blocking support
-  Reading, creation and update of data of image blocks
-  Affine geotransform, WKT projection, GCP
-  Metadata at dataset and band level
-  Per-band description
-  Per-band nodata and color interpretation
-  Per-band color table
-  Per-band RAT (Raster Attribute Table) of arbitrary size
-  Internal overviews and mask bands

Creation options
----------------

The following creation options are available. Some are rather esoteric
and should rarely be specified, unless the user has good knowledge of
the working of the underlying HDF5 format.

-  **IMAGEBLOCKSIZE**\ =integer_value: The size of each block for image
   data. Defaults to 256

-  **ATTBLOCKSIZE**\ =integer_value: The size of each block for
   attribute data. Defaults to 1000

-  **MDC_NELMTS**\ =integer_value: Number of elements in the meta data
   cache. Defaults to 0. See the `Data
   caching <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Caching.html>`__
   page of HDF5 documentation.

-  **RDCC_NELMTS**\ =integer_value: Number of elements in the raw data
   chunk cache. Defaults to 512. See the `Data
   caching <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Caching.html>`__
   page of HDF5 documentation.

-  **RDCC_NBYTES**\ =integer_value: Total size of the raw data chunk
   cache, in bytes. Defaults to 1048576. See the `Data
   caching <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Caching.html>`__
   page of HDF5 documentation.

-  **RDCC_W0**\ =floating_point_value between 0 and 1: Preemption
   policy. Defaults to 0.75. See the `Data
   caching <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Caching.html>`__
   page of HDF5 documentation.

-  **SIEVE_BUF**\ =integer_value: Sets the maximum size of the data
   sieve buffer. Defaults to 65536. See
   `H5Pset_sieve_buf_size() <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetSieveBufSize>`__
   documentation

-  **META_BLOCKSIZE**\ =integer_value: Sets the minimum size of metadata
   block allocations. Defaults to 2048. See
   `H5Pset_meta_block_size() <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetMetaBlockSize>`__
   documentation

-  **DEFLATE**\ =integer_value: Compression level between 0 (no
   compression) to 9 (max compression). Defaults to 1

-  **THEMATIC**\ =YES/NO: If YES then all bands are set to thematic.
   Defaults to NO
