PDF -- Geospatial PDF
================================================================================

.. shortname:: PDF

.. build_dependencies:: none for write support, Poppler/PoDoFo/PDFium for read support

GDAL supports reading Geospatial PDF documents, by extracting
georeferencing information and rasterizing the data. Non-geospatial PDF
documents will also be recognized by the driver.

PDF documents can be created from other
GDAL raster datasets, and OGR datasources can also optionally be drawn
on top of the raster layer (see OGR\_\* creation options in the below
section).

The driver supports reading georeferencing encoded in either of the 2
current existing ways : according to the OGC encoding best practice, or
according to the Adobe Supplement to ISO 32000.

Multipage documents are exposed as subdatasets, one subdataset par page
of the document.

Vector support
--------------

See the :ref:`PDF vector <vector.pdf>` documentation page

Metadata
--------

The neatline (for OGC best practice) or the bounding box (Adobe style)
will be reported as a NEATLINE metadata item, so that it can be later
used as a cutline for the warping algorithm.

XMP metadata can be extracted from the file,
and will be stored as XML raw content in the xml:XMP metadata domain.

Additional metadata, such as found in USGS
Topo PDF can be extracted from the file, and will be stored as XML raw
content in the EMBEDDED_METADATA metadata domain.

Configuration options
---------------------

-  *GDAL_PDF_DPI* : To control the dimensions of the raster by
   specifying the DPI of the rasterization with the Its default value is
   150. The driver will make some effort to
   guess the DPI value either from a specific metadata item contained in
   some PDF files, or from the raster images inside the PDF (in simple
   cases).
-  *GDAL_PDF_NEATLINE* : The name of the neatline to
   select (only available for geospatial PDF, encoded according to OGC
   Best Practice). This defaults to "Map Layers" for USGS Topo PDF. If
   not found, the neatline that covers the largest area.
-  *GDAL_USER_PWD* : User password for protected PDFs.
-  *GDAL_PDF_RENDERING_OPTIONS* : a combination of VECTOR, RASTER and
   TEXT separated by comma, to select whether vector, raster or text
   features should be rendered. If the option is not specified, all
   features are rendered (Poppler and PDFium).
-  *GDAL_PDF_BANDS* = 3 or 4 : whether the PDF should be rendered as a
   RGB (3) or RGBA (4) image. The default value will depend on the PDF rendering
   used (Poppler vs PDFium) and on the content found in the PDF file (if an
   image with transparency is recognized, then 4 will be used). When 3 bands
   is selected, a white background is used.
-  *GDAL_PDF_LAYERS* = list of layers (comma separated) to turn ON (or
   "ALL" to turn all layers ON). The layer names can be obtained by
   querying the LAYERS metadata domain. When this option is specified,
   layers not explicitly listed will be turned off (Poppler and PDFium).
-  *GDAL_PDF_LAYERS_OFF* = list of layers (comma separated) to turn OFF.
   The layer names can be obtained by querying the LAYERS metadata
   domain (Poppler and PDFium).
-  "GDAL_PDF_LAUNDER_LAYER_NAMES* = YES/NO: (GDAL >= 3.1) Can be set to NO
   to avoid the layer names reported in the LAYERS metadata domain or as OGR
   layers for the vector part to be "laundered".

LAYERS Metadata domain
----------------------

When GDAL is compiled against Poppler
or PDFium, the LAYERS metadata domain can be queried to retrieve layer
names that can be turned ON or OFF. This is useful to know which values
to specify for the *GDAL_PDF_LAYERS* or *GDAL_PDF_LAYERS_OFF*
configuration options.

For example :

::

   $ gdalinfo ../autotest/gdrivers/data/adobe_style_geospatial.pdf -mdd LAYERS

   Driver: PDF/Geospatial PDF
   Files: ../autotest/gdrivers/data/adobe_style_geospatial.pdf
   [...]
   Metadata (LAYERS):
     LAYER_00_NAME=New_Data_Frame
     LAYER_01_NAME=New_Data_Frame.Graticule
     LAYER_02_NAME=Layers
     LAYER_03_NAME=Layers.Measured_Grid
     LAYER_04_NAME=Layers.Graticule
   [...]

   $ gdal_translate ../autotest/gdrivers/data/adobe_style_geospatial.pdf out.tif --config GDAL_PDF_LAYERS_OFF "New_Data_Frame"

Restrictions
------------

The opening of a PDF document (to get the georeferencing) is fast, but
at the first access to a raster block, the whole page will be rasterized
(with Poppler), which can be a slow operation.

Note: some raster-only PDF files (such as some
USGS GeoPDF files), that are regularly tiled are exposed as tiled
dataset by the GDAL PDF driver, and can be rendered with any backends.

Only a few of the possible Datums available in the OGC best practice
spec have been currently mapped in the driver. Unrecognized datums will
be considered as being based on the WGS84 ellipsoid.

For documents that contain several neatlines in a page (insets), the
georeferencing will be extracted from the inset that has the largest
area (in term of screen points).

Creation Issues
---------------

PDF documents can be created from other GDAL raster datasets, that have
1 band (graylevel or with color table), 3 bands (RGB) or 4 bands (RGBA).

Georeferencing information will be written by default according to the
ISO32000 specification. It is also possible to write it according to the
OGC Best Practice conventions (but limited to a few datum and projection
types).

Note: PDF write support does not require linking to any backend.

Creation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **COMPRESS=[NONE/DEFLATE/JPEG/JPEG2000]**: Set the compression to use
   for raster data. DEFLATE is the default.

-  **STREAM_COMPRESS=[NONE/DEFLATE]**: Set the compression to use for
   stream objects (vector geometries, JavaScript content). DEFLATE is
   the default.

-  **DPI=value**: Set the DPI to use. Default to 72. May be
   automatically adjusted to higher value so that page dimension does
   not exceed the 14400 maximum value (in user units) allowed by
   Acrobat.

-  **WRITE_USERUNIT=YES/NO**: (GDAL >= 2.2) Whether the UserUnit setting
   computed from the DPI (UserUnit = DPI / 72.0) should be recorded in
   the file. When UserUnit is recorded, the raster size in pixels
   recognized by GDAL on reading remains identical to the source raster.
   When UserUnit is not recorded, the printed size will depends on the
   DPI value. If this parameter is not set, but DPI is specified, then
   it will default to NO (so that the printed size depends on the DPI
   value). If this parameter is not set and DPI is not specified, then
   UserUnit will be recorded (so that the raster size in pixels
   recognized by GDAL on reading remain identical to the source raster).

-  **PREDICTOR=[1/2]**: Only for DEFLATE compression. Might be set to 2
   to use horizontal predictor that can make files smaller (but not
   always!). 1 is the default.

-  **JPEG_QUALITY=[1-100]**: Set the JPEG quality when using JPEG
   compression. A value of 100 is best quality (least compression), and
   1 is worst quality (best compression). The default is 75.

-  **JPEG2000_DRIVER=[JP2KAK/JP2ECW/JP2OpenJPEG/JPEG2000]**: Set the
   JPEG2000 driver to use. If not specified, it will be searched in the
   previous list.

-  **TILED=YES**: By default monoblock files are created. This option
   can be used to force creation of tiled PDF files.

-  **BLOCKXSIZE=n**: Sets tile width, defaults to 256.

-  **BLOCKYSIZE=n**: Set tile height, defaults to 256.

-  **CLIPPING_EXTENT=xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax**: Set the clipping extent for
   the main source dataset and for the optional extra rasters. The
   coordinates are expressed in the units of the SRS of the dataset. If
   not specified, the clipping extent is set to the extent of the main
   source dataset.

-  **LAYER_NAME=name**: Name for layer where the raster is placed. If
   specified, the raster will be be placed into a layer that can be
   toggled/un-toggled in the "Layer tree" of the PDF reader.

-  **EXTRA_RASTERS=dataset_ids**: Comma separated list of georeferenced
   rasters to insert into the page. Those rasters are displayed on top
   of the main source raster. They must be georeferenced in the same
   projection, and they will be clipped to CLIPPING_EXTENT if it is
   specified (otherwise to the extent of the main source raster).

-  **EXTRA_RASTERS_LAYER_NAME=dataset_names**: Comma separated list of
   name for each raster specified in EXTRA_RASTERS. If specified, each
   extra raster will be be placed into a layer, named with the specified
   value, that can be toggled/un-toggled in the "Layer tree" of the PDF
   reader. If not specified, all the extra rasters will be placed in the
   default layer.

-  **EXTRA_STREAM=content**: A PDF content stream to draw after the
   imagery, typically to add some text. It may refer to any of the 14
   standard PDF Type 1 fonts (omitting hyphens), as /FTimesRoman,
   /FTimesBold, /FHelvetica, /FCourierOblique, ... , in which case the
   required resource dictionary will be inserted.

-  **EXTRA_IMAGES=image_file_name,x,y,scale[,link=some_url] (possibly
   repeated)**: A list of (ungeoreferenced) images to insert into the
   page as extra content. This is useful to insert logos, legends,
   etc... x and y are in user units from the lower left corner of the
   page, and the anchor point is the lower left pixel of the image.
   scale is a magnifying ratio (use 1 if unsure). If link=some_url is
   specified, the image will be selectable and its selection will cause
   a web browser to be opened on the specified URL.

-  **EXTRA_LAYER_NAME=name**: Name for layer where the extra content
   specified with EXTRA_STREAM or EXTRA_IMAGES is placed. If specified,
   the extra content will be be placed into a layer that can be
   toggled/un-toggled in the "Layer tree" of the PDF reader.

-  **MARGIN/LEFT_MARGIN/RIGHT_MARGIN/TOP_MARGIN/BOTTOM_MARGIN=value**:
   Margin around image in user units.

-  **GEO_ENCODING=[NONE/ISO32000/OGC_BP/BOTH]**: Set the Geo encoding
   method to use. ISO32000 is the default.

-  **NEATLINE=polygon_definition_in_wkt**: Set the NEATLINE to use.

-  **XMP=[NONE/xml_xmp_content]**: By default, if the source dataset has
   data in the 'xml:XMP' metadata domain, this data will be copied to
   the output PDF, unless this option is set to NONE. The XMP xml string
   can also be directly set to this option.

-  **WRITE_INFO=[YES/NO]**: By default, the AUTHOR, CREATOR,
   CREATION_DATE, KEYWORDS, PRODUCER, SUBJECT and TITLE information will
   be written into the PDF Info block from the corresponding metadata
   item from the source dataset, or if not set, from the corresponding
   creation option. If this option is set to NO, no information will be
   written.

-  **AUTHOR**, **CREATOR**, **CREATION_DATE**, **KEYWORDS**,
   **PRODUCER**, **SUBJECT**, **TITLE** : metadata that can be written
   into the PDF Info block. Note: the format of the value for
   CREATION_DATE must be D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm' (e.g.
   D:20121122132447+02'00' for 22 nov 2012 13:24:47 GMT+02) (see `PDF
   Reference, version
   1.7 <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf>`__,
   page 160)

-  **OGR_DATASOURCE=name** : Name of the OGR datasource to display on
   top of the raster layer.

-  **OGR_DISPLAY_FIELD=name** : Name of the field (matching the name of
   a field from the OGR layer definition) to use to build the label of
   features that appear in the "Model Tree" UI component of a well-known
   PDF viewer. For example, if the OGR layer has a field called "ID",
   this can be used as the value for that option : features in the
   "Model Tree" will be labelled from their value for the "ID" field. If
   not specified, sequential generic labels will be used ("feature1",
   "feature2", etc... ).

-  **OGR_DISPLAY_LAYER_NAMES=names** : Comma separated list of names to
   display for the OGR layers in the "Model Tree". This option is useful
   to provide custom names, instead of OGR layer name that are used when
   this option is not specified. When specified, the number of names
   should be the same as the number of OGR layers in the datasource (and
   in the order they appear when listed by ogrinfo for example).

-  **OGR_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES=YES/NO** : Whether to write attributes of OGR
   features. Defaults to YES

-  **OGR_LINK_FIELD=name** : Name of the field (matching the name of a
   field from the OGR layer definition) to use to cause clicks on OGR
   features to open a web browser on the URL specified by the field
   value.

-  **OFF_LAYERS=names**: Comma separated list of layer names that should
   be initially hidden. By default, all layers are visible. The layer
   names can come from LAYER_NAME (main raster layer name),
   EXTRA_RASTERS_LAYER_NAME, EXTRA_LAYER_NAME and
   OGR_DISPLAY_LAYER_NAMES.

-  **EXCLUSIVE_LAYERS=names**: Comma separated list of layer names, such
   that only one of those layers can be visible at a time. This is the
   behavior of radio-buttons in a graphical user interface. The layer
   names can come from LAYER_NAME (main raster layer name),
   EXTRA_RASTERS_LAYER_NAME, EXTRA_LAYER_NAME and
   OGR_DISPLAY_LAYER_NAMES.

-  **JAVASCRIPT=script**: Javascript content to run at document opening.
   See `Acrobat(R) JavaScript Scripting
   Reference <http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/sdk/AcroJS.pdf>`__.

-  **JAVASCRIPT_FILE=script_filename**: Name of Javascript file to embed
   and run at document opening. See `Acrobat(R) JavaScript Scripting
   Reference <http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/sdk/AcroJS.pdf>`__.

-  **COMPOSITION_FILE=xml_filename**: (GDAL >= 3.0) See below
   paragraph "Creation of PDF file from a XML composition file"

Update of existing files
------------------------

Existing PDF files (created or not with GDAL) can be opened in update
mode in order to set or update the following elements :

-  Geotransform and associated projection (with SetGeoTransform() and
   SetProjection())
-  GCPs (with SetGCPs())
-  Neatline (with SetMetadataItem("NEATLINE",
   polygon_definition_in_wkt))
-  Content of Info object (with SetMetadataItem(key, value) where key is
   one of AUTHOR, CREATOR, CREATION_DATE, KEYWORDS, PRODUCER, SUBJECT
   and TITLE)
-  xml:XMP metadata (with SetMetadata(md, "xml:XMP"))

For geotransform or GCPs, the Geo encoding method used by default is
ISO32000. OGC_BP can be selected by setting the GDAL_PDF_GEO_ENCODING
configuration option to OGC_BP.

Updated elements are written at the end of the file, following the
incremental update method described in the PDF specification.

Creation of PDF file from a XML composition file (GDAL >= 3.0)
--------------------------------------------------------------

A PDF file can be generate from a XML file that describes the
composition of the PDF:

-  number of pages
-  layer tree, with visibility state, exclusion groups
-  definition or 0, 1 or several georeferenced areas per page
-  page content made of rasters, vectors or labels

The GDALCreate() API must be used with width = height = bands = 0 and
datatype = GDT_Unknown and COMPOSITION_FILE must be the single creation
option.

The XML schema against which the composition file must validate is
`pdfcomposition.xsd <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/gdal/master/gdal/data/pdfcomposition.xsd>`__

Example on how to use the API:

.. code-block:: c++

   char** papszOptions = CSLSetNameValue(nullptr, "COMPOSITION_FILE", "the.xml");
   GDALDataset* ds = GDALCreate("the.pdf", 0, 0, 0, GDT_Unknown, papszOptions);
   // return a non-null (fake) dataset in case of success, nullptr otherwise.
   GDALClose(ds);
   CSLDestroy(papszOptions);

A sample Python script
`gdal_create_pdf.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/gdal/master/gdal/swig/python/samples/gdal_create_pdf.py>`__
is also available.

Example of a composition XML file:

Build dependencies
------------------

For read support, GDAL must be built against one of the following
libraries :

-  `Poppler <http://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`__ (GPL-licensed)
-  `PoDoFo <http://podofo.sourceforge.net/>`__ (LGPL-licensed)
-  `PDFium <https://code.google.com/p/pdfium/>`__ (New BSD-licensed,
   supported since GDAL 2.1.0)

Note: it is also possible to build against a combination of several of
the above libraries. PDFium will be used in priority over Poppler,
itself used in priority over PoDoFo.

Unix build
~~~~~~~~~~

The relevant configure options are --with-poppler, --with-podofo,
--with-podofo-lib and --with-podofo-extra-lib-for-test.

Starting with GDAL 2.1.0, --with-pdfium, --with-pdfium-lib,
--with-pdfium-extra-lib-for-test and --enable-pdf-plugin are also
available.

Poppler
~~~~~~~

libpoppler itself must have been configured with --enable-xpdf-headers
so that the xpdf C++ headers are available. Note: the poppler C++ API
isn't stable, so the driver compilation may fail with too old or too
recent poppler versions.

PoDoFo
~~~~~~

As a partial alternative, the PDF driver can be compiled against
libpodofo to avoid the libpoppler dependency. This is sufficient to get
the georeferencing and vector information. However, for getting the
imagery, the pdftoppm utility that comes with the poppler distribution
must be available in the system PATH. A temporary file will be generated
in a directory determined by the following configuration options :
CPL_TMPDIR, TMPDIR or TEMP (in that order). If none are defined, the
current directory will be used. Successfully tested versions are
libpodofo 0.8.4, 0.9.1 and 0.9.3. Important note: using PoDoFo 0.9.0 is
strongly discouraged, as it could cause crashes in GDAL due to a bug in
PoDoFo.

PDFium
~~~~~~

Using PDFium as a backend allows access to raster, vector,
georeferencing and other metadata. The PDFium backend has also support
for arbitrary overviews, for fast zoom-out.

Only GDAL builds against static builds of PDFium have been tested.
Building PDFium can be challenging, and particular builds must be used to
work properly with GDAL.

With GDAL >= 3.1.0
+++++++++++++++++++

The scripts in the <https://github.com/rouault/pdfium_build_gdal_3_1>`__
repository must be used to build a patched version of PDFium.

With GDAL >= 2.2.0 and < 3.1

A `PDFium forked version for simpler
builds <https://github.com/rouault/pdfium>`__ is available (for Windows,
a dedicated
`win_gdal_build <https://github.com/rouault/pdfium/tree/win_gdal_build>`__
branch is recommended). A `build
repository <https://github.com/rouault/pdfium/tree/build>`__ is
available with a few scripts that can be used as a template to build
PDFium for Linux/MacOSX/Windows. Those forked versions remove the
dependency to the V8 JavaScript engine, and have also a few changes to
avoid symbol clashes, on Linux, with libjpeg and libopenjpeg. Building
the PDF driver as a GDAL plugin is also a way of avoiding such issues.
PDFium build requires a C++11 compatible compiler, as well as for
building GDAL itself against PDFium. Successfully tested versions are
GCC 4.7.0 (previous versions aren't compatible) and Visual Studio 12 /
VS2013.

Examples
--------

-  Create a PDF from 2 rasters (main_raster and another_raster), such
   that main_raster is initially displayed, and they are exclusively
   displayed :

   ::

      gdal_translate -of PDF main_raster.tif my.pdf -co LAYER_NAME=main_raster
                     -co EXTRA_RASTERS=another_raster.tif -co EXTRA_RASTERS_LAYER_NAME=another_raster
                     -co OFF_LAYERS=another_raster -co EXCLUSIVE_LAYERS=main_raster,another_raster

-  Create of PDF with some JavaScript :

   ::

      gdal_translate -of PDF my.tif my.pdf -co JAVASCRIPT_FILE=script.js

   where script.js is :

   ::

      button = app.alert({cMsg: 'This file was generated by GDAL. Do you want to visit its website ?', cTitle: 'Question', nIcon:2, nType:2});
      if (button == 4) app.launchURL('http://gdal.org/');
