GRASS Raster Format
================================================================================

.. shortname:: GRASS

.. build_dependencies:: libgrass

GDAL optionally supports reading of existing GRASS raster maps or
imagery groups, but not writing or export. The support for GRASS raster
format is determined when the library is configured, and requires
libgrass to be pre-installed (see Notes below).

GRASS raster maps/imagery groups can be selected in several ways.

#. The full path to the ``cellhd`` file can be specified. This is not a
   relative path, or at least it must contain all the path components
   within the GRASS database including the database root itself. The
   following example opens the raster map "proj_tm" within the GRASS
   mapset "PERMANENT" of the GRASS location "proj_tm" in the GRASS
   database located at ``/u/data/grassdb``.

   For example:

   ::

      gdalinfo /u/data/grassdb/proj_tm/PERMANENT/cellhd/proj_tm

#. The full path to the directory containing information about an
   imagery group (or the REF file within it) can be specified to refer
   to the whole group as a single dataset. The following examples do the
   same thing.

   For example:

   ::

      gdalinfo /usr2/data/grassdb/imagery/raw/group/testmff/REF
      gdalinfo /usr2/data/grassdb/imagery/raw/group/testmff

#. If there is a correct ``.grassrc5`` (GRASS 5), ``.grassrc6`` (GRASS
   6) ``.grass7/rc`` (GRASS 7) setup file in the users home directory
   then raster maps or imagery groups may be opened just by the cell
   name. This only works for raster maps or imagery groups in the
   current GRASS location and mapset as defined in the GRASS setup file.

The following features are supported by the GDAL/GRASS link.

-  Up to 256 entries from raster colormaps are read (0-255).
-  Compressed and uncompressed integer (CELL), floating point (FCELL)
   and double precision (DCELL) raster maps are all supported. Integer
   raster maps are classified with a band type of "Byte" if the 1-byte
   per pixel format is used, or "UInt16" if the two byte per pixel
   format is used. Otherwise integer raster maps are treated as
   "UInt32".
-  Georeferencing information is properly read from GRASS format.
-  An attempt is made to translate coordinate systems, but some
   conversions may be flawed, in particular in handling of datums and
   units.

Driver capabilities

Notes on driver variations
--------------------------

For GRASS 5.7 Radim Blazek has moved the driver to using the GRASS
shared libraries directly instead of using libgrass. Currently (GDAL
1.2.2 and later) both version of the driver are available and can be
configured using ``--with-libgrass`` for the libgrass variant or
``--with-grass=<dir>`` for the new GRASS 5.7+ library based version. The
GRASS 5.7+ driver version is currently not supporting coordinate system
access, though it is hoped that will be corrected at some point.
