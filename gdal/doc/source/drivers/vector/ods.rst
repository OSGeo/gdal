ODS - Open Document Spreadsheet
===============================

.. shortname:: ODS

.. build_dependencies:: libexpat

This driver can read, write and update spreadsheets in Open Document
Spreadsheet format, used by applications like OpenOffice / LibreOffice /
KSpread / etc...

The driver is only available if GDAL/OGR is compiled against the Expat
library.

Each sheet is presented as a OGR layer. No geometry support is available
directly (but you may use the OGR VRT capabilities for that).

Note 1 : spreadsheets with passwords are not supported.

Note 2 : when updating an existing document, all existing styles,
formatting, formulas and other concepts (charts, drawings, macros, ...)
not understood by OGR will be lost : the document is re-written from
scratch from the OGR data model.

Configuration options
---------------------

-  OGR_ODS_HEADERS = FORCE / DISABLE / AUTO : By default, the driver
   will read the first lines of each sheet to detect if the first line
   might be the name of columns. If set to FORCE, the driver will
   consider the first line will be taken as the header line. If set to
   DISABLE, it will be considered as the first feature. Otherwise
   auto-detection will occur.
-  OGR_ODS_FIELD_TYPES = STRING / AUTO : By default, the driver will try
   to detect the data type of fields. If set to STRING, all fields will
   be of String type.
