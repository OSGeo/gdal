Community
================================================================================

GDAL's community interacts through `Mailing List`_, `GitHub`_, and
`IRC`_.  Please feel welcome to ask questions and participate in all of the
venues.  The `Mailing List`_ communication channel is for general questions,
development discussion, and feedback. The `GitHub`_ communication channel is
for development activities, bug reports, and testing. The `IRC`_
channel is for real-time chat activities such as meetings and interactive
debugging sessions.

Mailing List
------------

Developers and users of GDAL participate on the GDAL mailing list. It is OK to
ask questions about how to use GDAL, how to integrate GDAL into your own software,
and report issues that you might have.

GitHub
------

Visit http://github.com/OSGeo/GDAL to file issues you might be having with the
software. GitHub is also where you can obtain a current development version of the
software in the `git`_ revision control system. The GDAL project is eager to
take contributions in all forms, and we welcome those who are willing to roll
up their sleeves and start filing tickets, pushing code, generating builds, and
answering questions.



IRC
---

You can find some GDAL developers on IRC on #gdal at `Freenode`_. This mechanism
is usually reserved for active meetings and other outreach with the community.
The `Mailing List`_ and `GitHub`_ avenues are going to be more productive
communication channels in most situations.
