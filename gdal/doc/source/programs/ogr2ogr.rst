Description
-----------

:program:`ogr2ogr` can be used to convert simple features data between file
formats. It can also perform various operations during the process, such as
spatial or attribute selection, reducing the set of attributes, setting the
output coordinate system or even reprojecting the features during translation.

.. program:: ogr2ogr

.. option:: -f <format_name>

    Output file format name, e.g. ``ESRI Shapefile``, ``MapInfo File``,
    ``PostgreSQL``.  Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the format is
    guessed from the extension (previously was ESRI Shapefile).

.. option:: -append

    Append to existing layer instead of creating new

.. option:: -overwrite

    Delete the output layer and recreate it empty

.. option:: -update

    Open existing output datasource in update mode rather than trying to create
    a new one

.. option:: -select <field_list>

    Comma-delimited list of fields from input layer to copy to the new layer. A
    field is skipped if mentioned previously in the list even if the input
    layer has duplicate field names. (Defaults to ``all``; any field is skipped
    if a subsequent field with same name is found.) Geometry fields can also be
    specified in the list.

    Note this setting cannot be used together with ``-append``. To control the
    selection of fields when appending to a layer, use ``-fieldmap`` or ``-sql``.

.. option:: -progress

    Display progress on terminal. Only works if input layers have the "fast
    feature count" capability.

.. option:: -sql <sql_statement>

    SQL statement to execute. The resulting table/layer will be saved to the
    output. Starting with GDAL 2.1, the ``@filename`` syntax can be used to
    indicate that the content is in the pointed filename.

.. option:: -dialect <dialect>

    SQL dialect. In some cases can be used to use (unoptimized) OGR SQL instead
    of the native SQL of an RDBMS by passing OGRSQL. The "SQLITE" dialect can
    also be used with any datasource.

.. option:: -where restricted_where

    Attribute query (like SQL WHERE). Starting with GDAL 2.1, the ``@filename``
    syntax can be used to indicate that the content is in the pointed filename.

.. option:: -skipfailures

    Continue after a failure, skipping the failed feature.

.. option:: -spat <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>

    spatial query extents, in the SRS of the source layer(s) (or the one
    specified with ``-spat_srs``). Only features whose geometry intersects the
    extents will be selected. The geometries will not be clipped unless
    ``-clipsrc`` is specified.

.. option:: -spat_srs <srs_def>

    Override spatial filter SRS.

.. option:: -geomfield <field>

    Name of the geometry field on which the spatial filter operates on.

.. option:: -dsco NAME=VALUE

    Dataset creation option (format specific)

.. option:: -lco NAME=VALUE

    Layer creation option (format specific)

.. option:: -nln <name>

    Assign an alternate name to the new layer

.. option:: -nlt <type>

    Define the geometry type for the created layer. One of ``NONE``,
    ``GEOMETRY``, ``POINT``, ``LINESTRING``, ``POLYGON``,
    ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION``, ``MULTIPOINT``, ``MULTIPOLYGON``,
    ``MULTILINESTRING``, ``CIRCULARSTRING``, ``COMPOUNDCURVE``,
    ``CURVEPOLYGON``, ``MULTICURVE``, and ``MULTISURFACE`` non-linear geometry
    types. Add ``Z``, ``M``, or ``ZM`` to the type name to specify coordinates
    with elevation, measure, or elevation and measure. ``PROMOTE_TO_MULTI`` can
    be used to automatically promote layers that mix polygon or multipolygons
    to multipolygons, and layers that mix linestrings or multilinestrings to
    multilinestrings. Can be useful when converting shapefiles to PostGIS and
    other target drivers that implement strict checks for geometry types.
    ``CONVERT_TO_LINEAR`` can be used to to convert non-linear geometry types
    into linear geometry types by approximating them, and ``CONVERT_TO_CURVE`` to
    promote a non-linear type to its generalized curve type (``POLYGON`` to
    ``CURVEPOLYGON``, ``MULTIPOLYGON`` to ``MULTISURFACE``, ``LINESTRING`` to
    ``COMPOUNDCURVE``, ``MULTILINESTRING`` to ``MULTICURVE``). Starting with
    version 2.1 the type can be defined as measured ("25D" remains as an alias for
    single "Z"). Some forced geometry conversions may result in invalid
    geometries, for example when forcing conversion of multi-part multipolygons
    with ``-nlt POLYGON``, the resulting polygon will break the Simple Features
    rules.

    Starting with GDAL 3.0.5, ``-nlt CONVERT_TO_LINEAR`` and ``-nlt PROMOTE_TO_MULTI``
    can be used simultaneously.

.. option:: -dim <val>

    Force the coordinate dimension to val (valid values are ``XY``, ``XYZ``,
    ``XYM``, and ``XYZM`` - for backwards compatibility ``2`` is an alias for
    ``XY`` and ``3`` is an alias for ``XYZ``). This affects both the layer
    geometry type, and feature geometries. The value can be set to ``layer_dim``
    to instruct feature geometries to be promoted to the coordinate dimension
    declared by the layer. Support for M was added in GDAL 2.1.

.. option:: -a_srs <srs_def>

    Assign an output SRS. Srs_def can be a full WKT definition (hard to escape
    properly), or a well known definition (i.e. EPSG:4326) or a file with a WKT
    definition.

.. option:: -t_srs <srs_def>

    Reproject/transform to this SRS on output.

.. option:: -s_srs <srs_def>

    Override source SRS.

.. option:: -ct <string>

    A PROJ string (single step operation or multiple step string starting with
    +proj=pipeline), a WKT2 string describing a CoordinateOperation, or a
    urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX URN overriding the default
    transformation from the source to the target CRS. It must take into account
    the axis order of the source and target CRS.

    .. versionadded:: 3.0

.. option:: -preserve_fid

    Use the FID of the source features instead of letting the output driver
    automatically assign a new one (for formats that require an FID).  If not
    in append mode, this behavior is the default if the output driver has
    a FID layer creation option, un which case the name of the source FID
    column will be used and source feature IDs will be attempted to be
    preserved. This behavior can be disabled by setting ``-unsetFid``.

.. option:: -fid fid

    If provided, only the feature with the specified feature id will be
    processed.  Operates exclusive of the spatial or attribute queries. Note: if
    you want to select several features based on their feature id, you can also
    use the fact the 'fid' is a special field recognized by OGR SQL. So,
    `-where "fid in (1,3,5)"` would select features 1, 3 and 5.

.. option:: -limit nb_features

    Limit the number of features per layer.

.. option:: -oo NAME=VALUE

    Input dataset open option (format specific).

.. option:: -doo NAME=VALUE

    Destination dataset open option (format specific), only valid in -update mode.

.. option:: -gt n

    Group n features per transaction (default 20000). Increase the value for
    better performance when writing into DBMS drivers that have transaction
    support. ``n`` can be set to unlimited to load the data into a single
    transaction.

.. option:: -ds_transaction

    Force the use of a dataset level transaction (for drivers that support such
    mechanism), especially for drivers such as FileGDB that only support
    dataset level transaction in emulation mode.

.. option:: -clipsrc [xmin ymin xmax ymax]|WKT|datasource|spat_extent

    Clip geometries to the specified bounding box (expressed in source SRS),
    WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON), from a datasource or to the spatial
    extent of the -spa.. option if you use the spat_extent keyword. When
    specifying a datasource, you will generally want to use it in combination
    of the -clipsrclayer, -clipsrcwhere or -clipsrcsql options

.. option:: -clipsrcsql <sql_statement>

    Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.

.. option:: -clipsrclayer <layername>

    Select the named layer from the source clip datasource.

.. option:: -clipsrcwhere <expression>

    Restrict desired geometries based on attribute query.

.. option:: -clipdst <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>

    Clip geometries after reprojection to the specified bounding box (expressed
    in dest SRS), WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON) or from a datasource.
    When specifying a datasource, you will generally want to use it in
    combination of the -clipdstlayer, -clipdstwhere or -clipdstsq.. options

.. option:: -clipdstsql <sql_statement>

    Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.

.. option:: -clipdstlayer <layername>

    Select the named layer from the destination clip datasource.

.. option:: -clipdstwhere <expression>

    Restrict desired geometries based on attribute query.

.. option:: -wrapdateline

    Split geometries crossing the dateline meridian (long. = +/- 180deg)

.. option:: -datelineoffset

    Offset from dateline in degrees (default long. = +/- 10deg, geometries
    within 170deg to -170deg will be split)

.. option:: -simplify <tolerance>

    Distance tolerance for simplification. Note: the algorithm used preserves
    topology per feature, in particular for polygon geometries, but not for a
    whole layer.

.. option:: -segmentize <max_dist>

    Maximum distance between 2 nodes. Used to create intermediate points.

.. option:: -makevalid

    Run the :cpp:func:`OGRGeometry::MakeValid` operation, followed by
    :cpp:func:`OGRGeometryFactory::removeLowerDimensionSubGeoms`, on geometries 
    to ensure they are valid regarding the rules of the Simple Features specification.

    .. versionadded: 3.1 (requires GEOS 3.8 or later)

.. option:: -fieldTypeToString type1,...

    Converts any field of the specified type to a field of type string in the
    destination layer. Valid types are : Integer, Integer64, Real, String,
    Date, Time, DateTime, Binary, IntegerList, Integer64List, RealList,
    StringList. Special value All can be used to convert all fields to strings.
    This is an alternate way to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may
    avoid typing a long SQL query. Note that this does not influence the field
    types used by the source driver, and is only an afterwards conversion.

.. option:: -mapFieldType srctype|All=dsttype,...

    Converts any field of the specified type to another type. Valid types are :
    Integer, Integer64, Real, String, Date, Time, DateTime, Binary,
    IntegerList, Integer64List, RealList, StringList. Types can also include
    subtype between parenthesis, such as Integer(Boolean), Real(Float32), ...
    Special value All can be used to convert all fields to another type. This
    is an alternate way to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may avoid
    typing a long SQL query. This is a generalization of -fieldTypeToString.
    Note that this does not influence the field types used by the source
    driver, and is only an afterwards conversion.

.. option:: -unsetFieldWidth

    Set field width and precision to 0.

.. option:: -splitlistfields

    Split fields of type StringList, RealList or IntegerList into as many
    fields of type String, Real or Integer as necessary.

.. option:: -maxsubfields <val>

    To be combined with ``-splitlistfields`` to limit the number of subfields
    created for each split field.

.. option:: -explodecollections

    Produce one feature for each geometry in any kind of geometry collection in
    the source file, applied after any ``-sql`` option.

.. option:: -zfield <field_name>

    Uses the specified field to fill the Z coordinate of geometries.

.. option:: -gcp <ungeoref_x> <ungeoref_y> <georef_x> <georef_y> <elevation>

    Add the indicated ground control point. This option may be provided
    multiple times to provide a set of GCPs.

.. option:: -order <n>

    Order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to select a
    polynomial order based on the number of GCPs.

.. option:: -tps

    Force use of thin plate spline transformer based on available GCPs.

.. option:: -fieldmap

    Specifies the list of field indexes to be copied from the source to the
    destination. The (n)th value specified in the list is the index of the
    field in the target layer definition in which the n(th) field of the source
    layer must be copied. Index count starts at zero. To omit a field, specify
    a value of -1. There must be exactly as many values in the list as the
    count of the fields in the source layer. We can use the 'identity' setting
    to specify that the fields should be transferred by using the same order.
    This setting should be used along with the ``-append`` setting.

.. option:: -addfields

    This is a specialized version of ``-append``. Contrary to ``-append``,
    ``-addfields`` has the effect of adding, to existing target layers, the new
    fields found in source layers. This option is useful when merging files
    that have non-strictly identical structures. This might not work for output
    formats that don't support adding fields to existing non-empty layers. Note
    that if you plan to use -addfields, you may need to combine it with
    -forceNullable, including for the initial import.

.. option:: -relaxedFieldNameMatch

    Do field name matching between source and existing target layer in a more
    relaxed way if the target driver has an implementation for it.

.. option:: -forceNullable

    Do not propagate not-nullable constraints to target layer if they exist in
    source layer.

.. option:: -unsetDefault

    Do not propagate default field values to target layer if they exist in
    source layer.

.. option:: -unsetFid

    Can be specify to prevent the name of the source FID column and source
    feature IDs from being re-used for the target layer. This option can for
    example be useful if selecting source features with a ORDER BY clause.

.. option:: -nomd

    To disable copying of metadata from source dataset and layers into target
    dataset and layers, when supported by output driver.

.. option:: -mo META-TAG=VALUE

    Passes a metadata key and value to set on the output dataset, when
    supported by output driver.

.. option:: -noNativeData

    To disable copying of native data, i.e. details of source format not
    captured by OGR abstraction, that are otherwise preserved by some drivers
    (like GeoJSON) when converting to same format.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

Performance Hints
-----------------

When writing into transactional DBMS (SQLite/PostgreSQL,MySQL, etc...), it
might be beneficial to increase the number of INSERT statements executed
between BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements. This number is
specified with the -gt option. For example, for SQLite, explicitly defining -gt
65536 ensures optimal performance while populating some table containing many
hundreds of thousands or millions of rows. However, note that -skipfailures
overrides -gt and sets the size of transactions to 1.

For PostgreSQL, the PG_USE_COPY config option can be set to YES for a
significant insertion performance boost. See the PG driver documentation page.

More generally, consult the documentation page of the input and output drivers
for performance hints.

C API
-----

This utility is also callable from C with :cpp:func:`GDALVectorTranslate`.

.. versionadded::2.1

Examples
--------

Basic conversion from Shapefile to GeoPackage:

.. code-block::

  ogr2ogr \
    -f GPKG output.gpkg \
    input.shp

Change the coordinate reference system from ``EPSG:4326`` to ``EPSG:3857``:

.. code-block::

  ogr2ogr \
    -s_srs EPSG:4326 \
    -t_srs EPSG:3857 \
    -f GPKG output.gpkg \
    input.gpkg

Example appending to an existing layer (both ``-update`` and ``-append`` flags need to be used):

.. code-block::

    ogr2ogr -update -append -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda abc.tab

Clip input layer with a bounding box (<xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>):

.. code-block::

  ogr2ogr \
    -spat -13.931 34.886 46.23 74.12 \
    -f GPKG output.gpkg \
    natural_earth_vector.gpkg

Filter Features by a ``-where`` clause:

.. code-block::

  ogr2ogr \
    -where "\"POP_EST\" < 1000000" \
    -f GPKG output.gpkg \
    natural_earth_vector.gpkg \
    ne_10m_admin_0_countries


Example reprojecting from ETRS_1989_LAEA_52N_10E to EPSG:4326 and clipping to a bounding box:

.. code-block::

    ogr2ogr -wrapdateline -t_srs EPSG:4326 -clipdst -5 40 15 55 france_4326.shp europe_laea.shp

Example for using the ``-fieldmap`` setting. The first field of the source layer is
used to fill the third field (index 2 = third field) of the target layer, the
second field of the source layer is ignored, the third field of the source
layer used to fill the fifth field of the target layer.

.. code-block::

    ogr2ogr -append -fieldmap 2,-1,4 dst.shp src.shp

More examples are given in the individual format pages.
