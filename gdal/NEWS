 * Allow fast NONE overview generation (#2677)
 * Added in GDALRasterBand::GetRasterSampleOverview() and ComputeRasterMinMax() (#2148)
 * Preliminary gmljp2 specific changes to address axis orientation (#2131)
 * Added GDALProxyDataset and GDALProxyRasterBand abstract classes to be able to make proxy datasets and raster bands

OGR 1.3.0 - Overview of Changes
-------------------------------

OGRGeometry:
 - WKT (and GML) encoding now attempts to preserve pretty much full double
   precision. 
 - geometries are now "coordinate dimension preserving" rather than dynamically
   figuring out dimension depending on whether Z is set.  So a geometry can

o GIF Driver:
- Added .wld world file support.
- Added transparency read support.
- Upgraded to libungif 4.x.

environment variable (measured in MB).

o Added Driver implementation tutorial to documentation.

o Added apps/gdaltindex.c - application for building tile indexed raster
datasets suitable for use with UMN MapServer.


GDAL 1.1.5 Significant Bug Fixes
--------------------------------

o SAR_CEOS:

o GeoTIFF:
- Fixed handling of RGBA band ordering on big endian systems.
- Fixed bugs in overview generation, especially when updating in place.

o gdal-config should work properly in all situations now.

o JPEG Driver: improved magic number tested to avoid ignoring some jpeg files.

o FITS Driver: lots of fixes and improvements.


OGR 1.1.5 New Features
----------------------

o Implemented support for attribute query filters (SetAttributeFilter())
on OGRLayer, provided SWQ based implementation, plugged into all
drivers and added hooks to ogrinfo.

o MapInfo Driver:
- Added accelerated spatial query support.
- Upgraded to current MITAB source as of GDAL release date.

o S-57 Driver:
- Added support for applying S-57 updates automatically.

o SDTS Driver:
- Added ENID and SNID to line features.
- Return coordinate system in WKT instead of PROJ.4 format.

- Auto determine shapefile type from first object written.
- Added good support for NULL shapes, and NULL attribute fields.
- Added support for .prj files (read and write).

o PostgreSQL Driver:
- Added PostGIS support.
- Pass attribute queries through to PostgreSQL.

o NTF Driver:
- Added support for GTYPE 5 geometries (a type of arc).
- Added support for GEOMETRY3D records in indexed (generic) datasets.

o TIGER/Line Driver:
- Added write support.
- Improved read support for TIGER 2000.

o OLE DB Provider:
- Added support for spatial queries via ICommand parameters.
- Added support for attribute queries by parsing out WHERE clause.
- In general substantial rework and extentions were made to make it
work with ESRI and AutoDesk clients.

o Added gdal/data/stateplane.txt - a test file with one line per state plane
zone for applications wanting to present options to users.

o Install ogrsf_frmts.a on install if building with OGR support enabled.

o Reports layer extents in ogrinfo.

- Improved IsSame() test for GEOGCS now.
- Fixed crash if PROJECTION missing from PROJCS definition.

o S-57:
- Improve recovery from corrupt line geometries.
- Read objects as generic if the object class is not recognised.
- Handle LIST attributes as a string, instead of as a single int.

o NTF:
- Fixed circle conversion to polylines to close the circle properly.
- Upped MAX_LINK to 5000 to handle much more complex geometries.

o DGN:
- Don't include elements with the complex bit set in extents
computations.
