== Backward compatibility issues ==

Due to the 2-digit number '10' in GDAL 1.10, the GDAL_VERSION_NUM macro has been changed.
The new advised way of testing the GDAL version number (for GDAL 1.10 or later) at compilation time is :

#ifdef GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION /* only available in GDAL 1.10 or later */
#if GDAL_VERSION_NUM >= GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION(1,10,0)
///
#endif
#endif

Testing of previous versions is of course unchanged.

== SWIG Language Bindings ==

General :
 * RFC 30: Correct the signature of Datasource.CreateDataSource() and DeleteDataSource(),  gdal.Unlink() to accept UTF-8 filenames (#3766)
 * Add Band.GetCategoryNames() and Band.SetCategoryNames()
 * Add Geometry.GetPoints() (only for Python and Java) (#4016)
 * Add Geometry.GetEnvelope3D()
 * Add Geometry.SimplifyPreserveTopology()
 * Extend SWIG Geometry.ExportToJson() to accept a list of options (#4108)
 * Add (OGR)DataSource.SyncToDisk()
 * Add SpatialReference.SetVertCS(), IsSameVertCS(), IsVertical(), SetCompount(), IsCompound()
 * Add SpatialReference.SetIGH() (#4060)
 * RFC 35: Add OGRLayer.DeleteField(), ReorderField(), ReorderFields(), AlterFieldDefn()
 * Add gdal.VSIFTruncateL()

CSharp bindings:
 * Implement the typemap for utf8_path in C# (#3766)
 * Correcting the signature of OGRDataSource.Open to make the utf8 typemap to work (#3766)

Java bindings:
 * Turn the gdalJNI, gdalconstJNI and osrJNI into package private classes
 * Make Layer.GetExtent() return null when OGR_L_GetExtent() fails.

Perl bindings:
 * The "Points" method of Geometry was not accepting its own output in the case of a single point. It accepted only a point as a list. Now it accepts a point both as a list containing one point (a ref to a point as a list) and a point as a list.
 * Fixed UTF-8 support in decoding names (datasource, layer, field etc.).
 * Assume all GDAL strings are UTF-8, handle all changes in typemaps.
 * Additions to Perl bindings due to new developments etc: Layer capabilities, GeometryType  method for Layer, improved create, new Export and Set methods for SpatialReference.
 * Detect context in a typemap which returns a array, this now returns a list in list context; the change affects at least GetExtent and GetEnvelope methods, which retain backward compatibility though new and/or changed methods: FeatureDefn::Name, FeatureDefn::GeometryIgnored, FeatureDefn::StyleIgnored, Feature::ReferenceGeometry, Feature::SetFrom, FieldDefn::Ignored, Geometry::AsJSON
 * Perl typemaps: more correct manipulation of the stack, more cases where a list is returned in a list context, better handling of callback_data @Band::COLORINTERPRETATIONS, Band methods Unit, ScaleAndOffset, GetBandNumber, RasterAttributeTable method LinearBinning
 * Typemaps for VSIF{Write|Read}L, tests and docs for some VSI* functions.
 * Perl bindings: better by name / by index logic, some checks for silent failures, return schema as a hash if wanted, support ->{field} syntax for features, return list attributes as lists or listrefs as wished so that ->{field} works for lists too (API change)

Python bindings:
 * Improvements for ogr.Feature field get/set
 * Add hack to bring Python 3.2 compatibility
 * First argument of VSIFWriteL() should accept buffers for Python3 compat
 * Fix reference leak in 'typemap(in) char **dict'
 * Add gdal.VSIStatL()
 * swig/python/setup.py : fix for virtualenv setups (#4285)
 * Layer.GetExtent() : add optional parameter can_return_null that can be set to allow returning None when OGR_L_GetExtent() fails
 * Make gdal.VSIFSeekL(), gdal.VSIFTellL() and gdal.VSIFTruncateL() use GIntBig instead of long for compat with 32bit platforms
 * Add script to build the python extensions with Python 2.7 and a mingw32 cross-compiler under Linux/Unix

Ruby bindings:

= GDAL/OGR 1.8.0 release notes =

(Note: Most changes/bugfixes between 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 that have already gone
to the 1.7.X maintenance releases are not mentioned hereafter.)

== In a nutshell... ==

* New GDAL drivers : GTX, HF2, JPEGLS, JP2OpenJPEG, JPIPKAK, KMLSUPEROVERLAY,
                     LOS/LAS, MG4Lidar, NTv2, OZI, PDF, RASDAMAN, XYZ
* New OGR drivers : AeronavFAA, ArcObjects, GPSBabel, HTF, LIBKML, MSSQLSpatial, NAS,
                    OpenAir, PDS, PGDump, SOSI, SUA, WFS
* Significantly improved OGR drivers : DXF, GML
* New implemented RFCs : RFC 7, RFC 24, RFC 28, RFC 29, RFC 30, RFC 33
* New utility : gdallocationinfo

== Backward compatibility issues ==

* MITAB driver: use "," for the OGR Feature Style id: parameter delimiter,
  not "." as per the spec. Known impacted application :
  MapServer (http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/3556)
* RFC 33 changes the way PixelIsPoint is handled for GeoTIFF (#3838,#3837)
* GML driver: write valid <gml:MultiGeometry> element instead of the non-conformant
  <gml:GeometryCollection>. For backward compatibility, recognize both syntax for

 * Added Gaussian resampling in overview building (#2137)
 * Added Mode resampling in overview building (#2347)
 * Allow fast NONE overview generation (#2677)
 * Added in GDALRasterBand::GetRasterSampleOverview() and ComputeRasterMinMax() (#2148)
 * Preliminary gmljp2 specific changes to address axis orientation (#2131)
 * Added GDALProxyDataset and GDALProxyRasterBand abstract classes to be able to make proxy datasets and raster bands

 * add support for writing 1, 2 and 4 bit data (#2436)
 * Attempt to preserve PROJCS name in sMapInfo.proName, and to capture it as the PROJCS name when reading.  This will hopefully preserve symbolic names like NAD_1983_StatePlane_Ohio_South_FIPS_3402_Feet instead of replacing them with something generic like "Lambert_Conformal_Conic" (#2422).
 * avoid reducing array sizes if writing them in random order (#2427)
