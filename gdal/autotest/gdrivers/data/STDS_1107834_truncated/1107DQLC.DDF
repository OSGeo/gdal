Edge matching is a process of matching elevation values along common
quadrangle edges. The objective of edge matching is to improve the
alignment of ridges and drains and overall topographic shaping and
representation. Code of 0 = not edge matched; 1 = edge match checked
and joined; 2 = not edge matched because adjoining DEM is on a
different horizontal or vertical datum; 3 = not edge matched because
the adjoining DEM is not part of the current project; 4 = not edge
matched because the adjoining DEM has a different vertical unit.00618 D 1   00041   310400010080DQLC56980000002DQLC2NULL SCHEME: The method for indicating no value for a cell in the
Cell module records contained in this transfer is described here. In
the Data Dictionary Domain module there are specific values that are
reserved to mean VOID and FILL for ELEVATION. VOID means there is no
elevation measurement available for a cell that falls within the
*geographic boundaries* of the DEM. (In the geographic coordinate
system the bounds of the DEM data are rectangular.) A fill also means
there is no data, but is used to make the DEM rectangular in the UTM
coordinate system.
