GDAL C++ Unit Tests package

Author: Mateusz Loskot (mateusz@loskot.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The C++ Unit Tests package is dedicated to Windows CE platform,
though it's runnable on desktop Windows.
It should also compile on Unix, but internally Windows paths (with \)are used,
so you may need to replace them with Unix paths (with /)

This package includes subset of tests from gdalautotest but implemented in
C++ language and TUT - C++ Unit Test Framework.
The C++ Unit Tests are based on GDAL C API, so they can be used to tests
both sets of GDAL APIs: C and C++.

Compilation for desktop Windows
-------------------------------------

Configuration:

Open makefile.vc in your favourite editor and check if section "CONFIGURATION"
looks correctly for your environment.
Makefile expects to find gdal_i.lib and gdalXY.dll in GDAL_ROOT location,
where XY is GDAL_VERSION.
Update the configuration block to fit your environment.
Customize GEOS_ROOT and PROJ4_ROOT variables.

Makefile tries to copy gdalXY.dll into 'gdalautotest\cpp' directory,
so test runner executable can find it without any problems.
Clean target will delete all binaries, executable and copied DLL.


Build:

nmake /f makefile.vc

Clean:

nmake /f makefile.vc clean

No project file is available for desktop Windows target.

-------------------------------------
Compilation for Windows CE system
-------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Currently, the project file is not integrated with GDAL project files,
           so Unit Test executable does not link automatically, unless you hack project
           settings yourself and configure linker settings properly.
           Please, wait for GDAL 1.4.0.


Use project file from 'msvc80ce' subdirectory

No makefile is available for Windows CE target.
