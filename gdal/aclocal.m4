# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED(MACRO)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED is a simple helper for making sure other macros have
#   been defined and thus are available for use.  This avoids random issues
#   where a macro isn't expanded.  Instead the configure script emits a
#   non-fatal:
#
#     ./configure: line 1673: AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL: command not found
#
#   It's like AC_REQUIRE except it doesn't expand the required macro.
#
#   Here's an example:
#
#     AX_REQUIRE_DEFINED([AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG])
