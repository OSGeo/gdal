== Outstanding Issues ==

In gdal/data we have several coordinate system dictionary files derived in one fashion or another from other source (via translation scripts):

* gdal/data/cubewerx_extra.wkt: derived from definitions distributed by Cubewerx, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2165
* gdal/data/ecw_cs.dat: Derived via much processing from ERMapper GDT definitions, rights unclear.  See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2162
* gdal/data/esri_extra.wkt: Derived with some processing from projections definitions in ArcGIS, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2163

== Included Libraries ==

* zlib: gdal/frmts/zlib
* libtiff: gdal/frmts/gtiff/libtiff
* libgeotiff: gdal/frmts/gtiff/libgeotiff
* libjpeg: gdal/frmts/jpeg/libjpeg
* libpng: gdal/frmts/png/libpng
* libgif/libungif: gdal/frmts/gif/libungif
* libcsf: gdal/frmts/pcraster/libcsf
* hdfeoslib: gdal/frmts/hdf4/hdf-eos

== Non-free Libraries ==

Note: all the following are build options, not required.

* Oracle OCI for OCI OGR driver. 
* ESRI SDE for SDE OGR Driver.
* ECW SDK for ECW/JP2ECW GDAL driver (close to free now I think). 
* Kakadu for JP2KAK GDAL driver. 
* MrSID SDK for MrSID/JP2MrSID driver. 
* DWGdirect library for DWG writing.

== Code Reviewed ==

=== gdal/port === 

* Various contributors including Daniel Morissette, Andrey Kiselev, Frank Warmerdam and Mateusz Loskot.
* cpl_minizip* files come from the "minizip" distribution. Placed under a modified BSD Licence (see port/LICENCE_minizip). Added to gdal/LICENSE.TXT

=== gdal/gcore ===

* Various contributed, but mostly FrankW. 
* All copyright held by FrankW. 
* Version.rc contributed without copyright notice by Martin Daly, clarification requested.  Martin explicitly agreed by email, notice applied, all ok. 

=== gdal/alg ===

* contour.cpp: Joint copyright between FrankW and ACT.
* gdal_crs.c: derived from old GRASS/UMichigan code also under MIT/X license, properly noted in headers. 
* gdalmediancut.cpp: derived from libtiff tiffmedian.c utility under a GDAL compatible license.  Properly noted in headers.
* gdalrasterize.cpp: Derived from OpenEV code.  Relicensed from LGPL to MIT/X by explicit grant from copyright holder (Frank Warmerdam).  
* gvgcpfit.c: Believed to be derived from Numerical Recipes in C.  It has not been used for some time, but was still in the CVS repository.  I have now removed it.
* llrasterize.c: Derived from GD which has compatible MIT/X license.  Properly noted in header. 
* thinplatespline.cpp: Contributed by VIZRT Inc.,  Relicensed to MIT/X with their explicit permission as noted in the header. 

=== gdal/bridge === 

* All FrankW, no issues of note.  

=== gdal/data ===

* Contains various data files without copyright messages embedded.
* cubewerx_extra.wkt: derived from definitions distributed by Cubewerx, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2165
* ecw_cs.dat: Derived via much processing from ERMapper GDT definitions, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2162
* esri_extra.wkt: Derived with some processing from projections definitions in ArcGIS, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2163
* ellipsoid.csv, gcs.csv, gdal_datum.csv, pcs.csv, prime_meridian.csv, projop_wparm.csv, unit_of_measure.csv: Derived from EPSG.  Modifications to EPSG data violate the EPSG use agreement (if we are to still attribute it to EPSG) so I have segregated changes into override files (ie. gcs.override.csv). 
* seed_2d.dgn, seed_3d.dgn: Exact source of these files is unclear.  The files contain no substantial creative content since all but the header elements were stripped.  Judged to acceptable use. 
* NTS-50kindex.csv: Provided by Matt Wilkie, derived from NRCan dataset, rights unclear.  See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2164 (closed - this file isn't actually in the source tree - it is separately distributed as part of FWTools!)


=== gdal/apps === 

* gdal_contour.cpp: copyright held by ACT. 
* gdaltindex.cpp: copyright held by DM Solutions.
* gdalwarp.cpp, gdalwarpsimple.cpp: copyright held by i-cubed. 
* gdaldem.cpp: copyright held by Matthew Perry, Even Rouault, and Howard Butler  
               Derived from code by Michael Shapiro, Olga Waupotitsch, Marjorie Larson, Jim Westervelt :
               U.S. Army CERL, 1993. GRASS 4.1 Reference Manual. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
               Construction Engineering Research Laboratories, Champaign, Illinois, 1-425. 
               Derived from modules of GRASS 4.1 (public domain), properly noted in the headers.
               See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2975

* ERMapper logo used with permissions. 
* "ru" subdirectory (Russian translations) by Andrey Kiselev. 

=== gdal/pymod ===

* gdal_merge.py: copyright held by Atlantis, under LGPL. This is an acceptable license and it is just noted as an exception to the general MIT/X rule for GDAL but no further action required.
* gdal2xyz.py: copyright me, under LGPL - relicensed MIT/X.
* gdal_wrap.c: Generated with SWIG under very permissive license (noted in file).

* all FrankW, clean.

=== gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/dxfdwg ===

should not be affected.
