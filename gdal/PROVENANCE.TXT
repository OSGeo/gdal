== Outstanding Issues ==

In gdal/data we have several coordinate system dictionary files derived in one fashion or another from other source (via translation scripts):

* gdal/data/cubewerx_extra.wkt: derived from definitions distributed by Cubewerx, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2165
* gdal/data/ecw_cs.wkt: Derived via much processing from ERMapper GDT definitions, rights unclear.  See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2162
* gdal/data/esri_extra.wkt: Derived with some processing from projections definitions in ArcGIS, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2163

== Included Libraries ==

* zlib: gdal/frmts/zlib
* libtiff: gdal/frmts/gtiff/libtiff
* libgeotiff: gdal/frmts/gtiff/libgeotiff
* libjpeg: gdal/frmts/jpeg/libjpeg
* libpng: gdal/frmts/png/libpng
* libgif/libungif: gdal/frmts/gif/libungif
* libcsf: gdal/frmts/pcraster/libcsf
* hdfeoslib: gdal/frmts/hdf4/hdf-eos

== Non-free Libraries ==

Note: all the following are build options, not required.

* Oracle OCI for OCI OGR driver.
* ESRI SDE for SDE OGR Driver.
* ECW SDK for ECW/JP2ECW GDAL driver (close to free now I think).
* Kakadu for JP2KAK GDAL driver.
* MrSID SDK for MrSID/JP2MrSID driver.
* DWGdirect library for DWG writing.

== Code Reviewed ==

=== gdal/port ===

* Various contributors including Daniel Morissette, Andrey Kiselev, Frank Warmerdam and Mateusz Loskot.
* cpl_minizip* files come from the "minizip" distribution. Placed under a modified BSD Licence (see port/LICENCE_minizip). Added to gdal/LICENSE.TXT

=== gdal/gcore ===

* Various contributed, but mostly FrankW.
* All copyright held by FrankW.
* Version.rc contributed without copyright notice by Martin Daly, clarification requested.  Martin explicitly agreed by email, notice applied, all ok.

=== gdal/alg ===

* contour.cpp: Joint copyright between FrankW and ACT.
* gdal_crs.c: derived from old GRASS/UMichigan code also under MIT/X license, properly noted in headers.
* gdalmediancut.cpp: derived from libtiff tiffmedian.c utility under a GDAL compatible license.  Properly noted in headers.
* gdalrasterize.cpp: Derived from OpenEV code.  Relicensed from LGPL to MIT/X by explicit grant from copyright holder (Frank Warmerdam).
* gvgcpfit.c: Believed to be derived from Numerical Recipes in C.  It has not been used for some time, but was still in the CVS repository.  I have now removed it.
* llrasterize.c: Derived from GD which has compatible MIT/X license.  Properly noted in header.
* thinplatespline.cpp: Contributed by VIZRT Inc.,  Relicensed to MIT/X with their explicit permission as noted in the header.

=== gdal/data ===

* Contains various data files without copyright messages embedded.
* cubewerx_extra.wkt: derived from definitions distributed by Cubewerx, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2165
* ecw_cs.wkt: Derived via much processing from ERMapper GDT definitions, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2162
* esri_extra.wkt: Derived with some processing from projections definitions in ArcGIS, rights unclear. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2163
* ellipsoid.csv, gcs.csv, gdal_datum.csv, pcs.csv, prime_meridian.csv, projop_wparm.csv, unit_of_measure.csv: Derived from EPSG.  Modifications to EPSG data violate the EPSG use agreement (if we are to still attribute it to EPSG) so I have segregated changes into override files (i.e. gcs.override.csv).
* seed_2d.dgn, seed_3d.dgn: Exact source of these files is unclear.  The files contain no substantial creative content since all but the header elements were stripped.  Judged to acceptable use.
* NTS-50kindex.csv: Provided by Matt Wilkie, derived from NRCan dataset, rights unclear.  See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2164 (closed - this file isn't actually in the source tree - it is separately distributed as part of FWTools!)

=== gdal/apps ===

* gdal_contour.cpp: copyright held by ACT.
* gdaltindex.cpp: copyright held by DM Solutions.
* gdalwarp.cpp, gdalwarpsimple.cpp: copyright held by i-cubed.
* gdaldem.cpp: copyright held by Matthew Perry, Even Rouault, and Howard Butler
               Derived from code by Michael Shapiro, Olga Waupotitsch, Marjorie Larson, Jim Westervelt :
               U.S. Army CERL, 1993. GRASS 4.1 Reference Manual. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
               Construction Engineering Research Laboratories, Champaign, Illinois, 1-425.
               Derived from modules of GRASS 4.1 (public domain), properly noted in the headers.
               See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2975

=== gdal/debian ===

* copyright somewhat unclear, not actually part of software.

=== gdal/doc ===

* no copyright messages in .dox files.
* ERMapper logo used with permissions.
* "ru" subdirectory (Russian translations) by Andrey Kiselev.

=== gdal/pymod ===

* gdal_merge.py: copyright held by Atlantis, under LGPL. This is an acceptable license and it is just noted as an exception to the general MIT/X rule for GDAL but no further action required.
* gdal2xyz.py: copyright me, under LGPL - relicensed MIT/X.
* gdal_wrap.c: Generated with SWIG under very permissive license (noted in file).
* Scripts mostly by me, all ok.

=== gdal/pymod/samples ===

* dgn_pge.cpp, dgn_pge.h, pge_test.cpp, vbe_pge.cpp: copyright Pacific Gas and Electric, all rights reserved!  (this has all been removed from trunk)
* web/* docs lack any copyright message.  The isff.txt originally came from Intergraph and dgn.html is a reformatted version of that.  Perhaps these ought to move out of GDAL CVS tree - action: this has been removed from svn. (#1813)

=== gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/dods ===

* all FrankW, clean.

=== gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/dxfdwg ===

* All FrankW, clean.

NOTE: This code is implemented on the basis of work by Mike Higgins.  The
BSB format is subject to US patent 5,727,090; however, that patent
apparently only covers *writing* BSB files, not reading them, so this code
should not be affected.
