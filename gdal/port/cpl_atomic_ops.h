/** Add a value to a pointed integer in a thread and SMP-safe way
  * and return the resulting value of the operation.
  *
  * This function, which in most cases is implemented by a few
  * efficient machine instructions, guarantees that the value pointed
  * by ptr will be incremented in a thread and SMP-safe way.
  * The variables for this function must be aligned on a 32-bit boundary.
  *
  * Depending on the platforms, this function can also act as a
  * memory barrier, but this should not be assumed.
  *
  * Current platforms/architectures where an efficient implementation
  * exists are MacOSX, MS Windows, i386/x86_64 with GCC and platforms
  * supported by GCC 4.1 or higher. For other platforms supporting
  * the pthread library, and when GDAL is configured with thread-support,
  * the atomicity will be done with a mutex, but with
  * reduced efficiently. For the remaining platforms, a simple addition
  * with no locking will be done...
