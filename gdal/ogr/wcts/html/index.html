<h1>OGR WCTS Implementation</h1>				

<b>Deprecated: See <a href="#security">Security Concern</a> section below.</b>
<p>

As a part of a project to implement a Coordinate Transformations Server for
<a href="http://www.dmsolutions.ca/">DM Solutions Group</a> I am implementing
a WCTS (Web Coordinate Transformation Server) attempting to conform to the
OpenGIS internal discussion paper 02-061r2.  This paper can be found in 
the OpenGIS internal documents are for 
<a href="http://www.opengis.org/">OpenGIS</a> members.<p>

Note that this is not yet a specification, it is a proposal that might be
adopted as a specification at some point, likely after further changes.  Thus
<i>WCTS</i> is a protocol in flux.<p>

This implementation is based on the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/classOGRSpatialReference.html">OGRSpatialReference</a> class
within the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR</a> library.
The underlying projections engine is 
<a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/proj">PROJ.4</a>, and the GML support
from <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr">OGR</a> is used.<p>

The code implementing the server can be found in the GDAL/OGR CVS tree
in the gdal/ogr/wcts directory, along with some sample request documents.
Currently all the server specific code is in the 
<a href="http://www.gdal.org/srctree/ogr/wcts/ogrwcts.cpp">
ogrwcts.cpp</a> file in this directory.<p>

Some <a href="imp_details.html">Implementation Details</a> on features and
limitations of the server are available.  There is also an 
<a href="install.html">Installation and Configuration</a> document.<P>

Some sample XML input requests are available for the following requests:<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.gdal.org/srctree/ogr/wcts/req_getcap.xml">GetCapabilities</a><p>
<li> <a href="http://www.gdal.org/srctree/ogr/wcts/req_istransformable.xml">IsTransformable</a><p>
<li> <a href="http://www.gdal.org/srctree/ogr/wcts/req_transform.xml">Transform</a><p>
<li> <a href="http://www.gdal.org/srctree/ogr/wcts/req_remote.xml">Transform using FileURL</a><p>
</ul>

A development server is running at http://maps.gdal.org/cgi-bin/ogrwcts.  Some
sample KVP encoded requests are:<p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://maps.gdal.org/cgi-bin/ogrwcts?REQUEST=GetCapabilities">
http://maps.gdal.org/cgi-bin/ogrwcts?REQUEST=GetCapabilities</a>: Fetch
the capabilities.<p>

<li> <a href="http://maps.gdal.org/cgi-bin/ogrwcts?REQUEST=IsTransformable&SOURCECRS=EPSG:4001&TARGETCRS=EPSG:4002">http://maps.gdal.org/cgi-bin/ogrwcts?REQUEST=IsTransformable&SOURCECRS=EPSG:4001&TARGETCRS=EPSG:4002</a>: Test
if EPSG:4001 can be transformed to EPSG:4002.<p>

</ul>

Note that WCTS does not support KVP (including the arguments in the URL) usage
for the actual transformation operations, so you need something that can
PUT the XML request data to utilize the transform operator.<p>

An <a href="client.html">HTML form</a>
based client (backed by a cgi-bin program) has been implemented
for user interface to WCTS services and testing.<p>

<h2><a id="security">Security Concern</a></h2>

The OGR WCTS server has been moved to "spike" due to lack of maintenance
and a non-trivial SSRF security bug.  In light of this problem, it is advised 
that this service only be used with caution.  Robert Coup describes it this way:
<p>

<i>
If the WCTS stuff is compiled with -DHAVE_CURL, then the ogrwcts process is
vulnerable to SSRF. The wctsclient process (which looks to me like a cgi
server) is always vulnerable, since it doesn't care about -DHAVE_CURL.<p>

(a) Either passing in a user-supplied URL which isn't validated before
requesting it - this leaves "internal" http services which should only be
readable to the server readable to any client.<p>

(b) Using a redirect to the gopher protocol a client can send HTTP POST
requests or other payloads to any host accessible to the server. *Why* curl
enables the gopher protocol is beyond me, but it does.<p>

We can protect against (b) by disabling redirect-following
(CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION=0). But we can't really protect against (a) at all
without adding some black/whitelist of IP addresses.<p>

Steps to reproduce:<p>

Overview:
<ol>
<li> send evil request to wctsclient or ogrwcts services
<li> wcts requests client-specified http url (via <FileUrl> in ogrwcts, or
WCTSServer/GMLURL in wctsclient)
<li> either that reveals private inf
</ol>
</i>

<h2>Other WCTS Implementations</h2>

Currently there is only one other WCTS implementation in existance.  That
is the one done by <a href="http://www.lat-lon.de">lat/lon</a>, the folks
that write the WCTS document.  That implementation is also open source, and
can be found within the <a href="http://www.deegree.org">deegree</a> project.
<p>

A user form for interacting with an instance of the deegree based server
is <a href="http://www.lat-lon.de/projekte_en.html#coord">available at lat/lon
</a>.<p>
