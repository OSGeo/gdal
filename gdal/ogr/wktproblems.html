<title>OGC WKT Coordinate System Issues</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>OGC WKT Coordinate System Issues</h1>

This document is intended to discuss some issues that arrise in attempting
to use OpenGIS Well Known Text descriptions of coordinate systems.  It
discusses various vendor implementations and issues between the original
<a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=829">
"Simple Features" specification (ie. SF-SQL 99-049)</a> and the newer 
<a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=999">
Coordinate Transformation Services (CT) specification (01-009)<a> which defines
an extended form of WKT. <p>

<h2>WKT Implementations</h2>

At this time I am aware of at least the following software packages
that use some form of WKT internally, or for interchange of coordinate
system descriptions:<p>

<ul>
<li> Oracle Spatial (WKT is used internall in MDSYS.WKT, loosely SFSQL based)
<p>
<li> ESRI - The Arc8 system's projection engine uses a roughly simple
features compatible description for projections.  I believe ESRI provided
the WKT definition for the simple features spec.<p>

<li> Cadcorp - Has the ability to read and write CT 1.0 style WKT.
Cadcorp wrote the CT spec. <p>

<li> OGR/GDAL - reads/writes WKT as its internal coordinate system description
format.  Attempts to support old and new forms as well as forms from ESRI.<p>

<li> FME - Includes WKT read/write capabilities built on OGR. <p>

<li> MapGuide - Uses WKT in the SDP data access API.  Roughly SF compliant.
<p>

<li> PostGIS - Keeps WKT in the spatial_ref_sys table, but it is up to 
clients to translate to PROJ.4 format for actual use.  I believe the
spatial_ref_sys table is populated using OGR generated translations. <p>

</ul>

<h2>Projection Parameters</h2>

The various specs do not list a set of projections, and the
parameters associated with them.  This leads to various selection of
parameter names (and sometimes projection names) from different vendors. 
I have attempted to maintain a list of WKT bindings for different
projections as part of my 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728081442/http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/">GeoTIFF Projections
List</a> registry.  Please try to adhere to the projection names and
parameters listed there.  That list also tries to relate the projections
to the GeoTIFF, EPSG and PROJ.4 formulations where possible.<p>

The one case where it isn't followed by a vendor that I am aware of ESRIs
definition of Lambert Conformal Conic.  In EPSG there is a 1SP and a 2SP 
form of this.  ESRI merges them, and just have different parameters depending
on the type. <p>

One other issue is that the CT specification does explicitly list parameters
for the Transverse Mercator, LCC 1SP and LCC 2SP projections; however,
it lists standard_parallel1 and standard_parallel2 as parameters for LCC 2SP
which conflicts with the existing usage of standard_parallel_1 and
standard_parallel_2 and conflicts with examples in the same CT spec.
My position is that the table in section 10.x of the CT spec is in error
and that the widely used form is correct.  Note that the table in the CT
spec conflicts with other examples in the same spec.<p>

A third issue is the formulation for Albers. While I have used 
longitude_of_center and latitude_of_center ESRI uses Central_meridian and
latitude_of_origin.<p>

ESRI:<p>
<pre>
PROJECTION["Albers"],
PARAMETER["False_Easting",1000000.0],
PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],
PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-126.0],
PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_1",50.0],
PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_2",58.5],
PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",45.0],
</pre>

OGR:<p>
<pre>
PROJECTION["Albers"],
PARAMETER["standard_parallel_1",50],
PARAMETER["standard_parallel_2",58.5],
PARAMETER["longitude_of_center",-126],
PARAMETER["latitude_of_center",45],
PARAMETER["false_easting",1000000],
PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
</pre>

<h2>Datum Names</h2>

In Simple Features style WKT, the name associated with a datum is the
only way to identify the datum.  In CT WKT the datum can also have a
TOWGS84 parameter indicating its relationship to WGS84, and an AUTHORITY 
parameter relating it to EPSG or some other authority space.  However, in 
SF WKT the name itself is the only key.<p>

By convention OGR and Cadcorp have translated the datum names in a particular
way from the EPSG database in order to produce comparible names.  The rule
is to convert all non alphanumeric characters to underscores, then to 
strip any leading, trailing or repeating underscores.   This produces well
behaved datum names like "Nouvelle_Triangulation_Francaise".<p>

However, other vendors have done different things.  ESRI seems to follow
a similar convention but prefixes all datum names with "D_" as well, giving
names like "D_WGS_1972".  Also they have lots of other differences for
reasons that are not clear.  For instance for what Cadcorp and OGR call
"Nouvelle_Triangulation_Francaise", they call it "D_NTF".  Oracle appears
to use the raw names without cleanup.  So for NTF they use
"NTF (Paris meridian)". <p>

The short result of this is that it is almost impossible to recognise and
compare datums between different Simple Features implementations, though I have
had some success in translating ESRI datum names to match Cadcorp/OGR 
conventions, with some special casing.<p>

<h2>Parameter Ordering</h2>

It is worthwhile keeping in mind that the BNF grammars for WKT in the SF
specs, and the CT spec imply specific orders for most items.  For 
instance the BNF for the PROJCS item in the CT spec is 

<pre>
&lt;projected cs&gt; = 
  PROJCS["&lt;name&gt;", &lt;geographic cs&gt;, &lt;projection&gt;, {&lt;parameter&gt;,}* &lt;linear unit&gt; {,&lt;twin axes&gt;}{,&lt;authority&gt;}]
</pre>

This clearly states that the PROJECTION keyword follows the GEOGCS, followed
by the UNIT, AXIS and AUTHORITY items.  Providing them out of order is 
technially a violation of the spec.  On the other hand, WKT consumers are
encouraged to be flexible on ordering.<p>

<h2>Units of PARAMETERs</h2>

The linear PARAMETER values in a PROJCS must be in terms of the linear
units for that PROJCS.  I think the only linear units are the false easting
and northing type values.  Thus, in common cases like a state plane 
zone in feet, the false easting and northing will also be in feet.<p>

The angular PARAMETER values in a PROJCS must be in terms of the angular
units of the GEOGCS.  If the GEOGCS is in gradians, for instance, then all
the projection angles must also be in gradians!<p>

<h2>Units of PRIMEM</h2>

What units should the prime meridian appear in?<p>

<ul>

<li> The CT 1.0 specification (7.3.14 PRIMEM) says <i>"The units of the 
<longitude> must be inferred from the context. If the PRIMEM clause occurs 
inside a GEOGCS, then the longitude units will match those of the geographic 
coordinate system."</i> 
Note: for a geocentric coordinate system, it says <i>"If the PRIMEM clause
occurs inside a GEOCCS, then the units will be in degrees"</i>.<p>

<li> The SF-SQL spec (99-049) does not attempt to address the issue of
units of the prime meridian.<p>

<li> Existing ESRI EPSG translation to WKT uses degrees for prime meridian,
even when the GEOGCS is in gradians as shown in their translation of EPSG 4807:

<pre>
GEOGCS["GCS_NTF_Paris",
  DATUM["D_NTF",
    SPHEROID["Clarke_1880_IGN",6378249.2,293.46602]],
  PRIMEM["Paris",2.337229166666667],
  UNIT["Grad",0.015707963267948967]]
</pre>

<li>OGR implements the same interpretation as ESRI for its
OGRSpatialReference class: the PRIMEM longitude is always in degrees.
See <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4524">GDAL Ticket #4524</a>

<pre>
GEOGCS["NTF (Paris)",
    DATUM["Nouvelle_Triangulation_Francaise_Paris",
        SPHEROID["Clarke 1880 (IGN)",6378249.2,293.4660212936269,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","7011"]],
        TOWGS84[-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","6807"]],
    PRIMEM["Paris",2.33722917,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","8903"]],
    UNIT["grad",0.01570796326794897,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9105"]],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","4807"]]
</pre>

<li> Cadcorp implements according to the CT 1.0 specification as shown in
their translation of EPSG 4807:

<pre>
GEOGCS["NTF (Paris)",
  DATUM["Nouvelle_Triangulation_Francaise",
    SPHEROID["Clarke 1880 (IGN)",6378249.2,293.466021293627,
      AUTHORITY["EPSG",7011]],
    TOWGS84[-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG",6275]],
  PRIMEM["Paris",2.5969213,
    AUTHORITY["EPSG",8903]],
  UNIT["grad",0.015707963267949,
    AUTHORITY["EPSG",9105]],
  AXIS["Lat",NORTH],
  AXIS["Long",EAST],
  AUTHORITY["EPSG",4807]]
</pre>

<li> Oracle Spatial 8.1.7 uses the following definition for what I assume
is supposed to be EPSG 4807.  Interestingly it does not bother with using
gradians, and it appears that the prime meridian is expressed in radians
with very low precision!

<pre>
GEOGCS [ "Longitude / Latitude (NTF with Paris prime meridian)", 
  DATUM ["NTF (Paris meridian)", 
    SPHEROID ["Clarke 1880 (IGN)", 6378249.200000, 293.466021]], 
  PRIMEM [ "", 0.000649 ], 
  UNIT ["Decimal Degree", 0.01745329251994330]]
</pre>

</ul>

<h2>Sign of TOWGS84 Rotations</h2>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

In EPSG there are two methods of defining the 7 parameter 
bursa wolf parameters, 9606 (position vector 7-parameter) and 
9607 (coordinate frame rotation).  The only difference is 
that the sign of the rotation coefficients is reversed between them.<p>
 
I (Frank Warmerdam) had somehow convinced myself that the TOWGS84 values in WKT 
were supposed to be done using the sense in 9606 (position 
vector 7-parameter) and that if I read a 9607 I would need to 
switch the rotation signs before putting it into a TOWGS84 
chunk in WKT.<p>

However, I see in the WKT dump you (Martin from Cadcorp) sent me you are using 
the 9607 sense. For instance, this item appears to use 9607 
values directly without switching the sign.<p>
 
<pre>
 GEOGCS["DHDN",
    DATUM["Deutsche_Hauptdreiecksnetz",
      SPHEROID["Bessel 1841",6377397.155,299.1528128,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7004"]],
      TOWGS84[582,105,414,-1.04,-0.35,3.08,8.3],
      AUTHORITY["EPSG","6314"]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
    UNIT["DMSH",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9108"]],
    AXIS["Lat",NORTH],AXIS["Long",EAST],AUTHORITY["EPSG","4314"]]
</pre>
 
I read over the TOWGS84[] clause in the 1.0 CT spec, and it 
just talks about them being the Bursa Wolf transformation 
parameters (on page 22, 7.3.18).  I also scanned through to 
12.3.15.2 and 12.3.27 and they are nonspecific as to the 
handedness of the TOWGS84 rotations.<p>
 
I am seeking a clarification of whether TOWGS84 matches EPSG 
9606 or EPSG 9607. Furthermore, I would like to see any 
future rev of the spec clarify this, referencing the EPSG 
method definitions.<p>

Martin wrote back that he was uncertain on the correct signage and that
the Adam had programmed the Cadcorp implementation imperically, according
to what seemed to work for the test data available.<p>

I am prepared to adhere to the Cadorp sign usage (as per EPSG 9607) if
this can be clarified in the specification.<p>

<h3>Current state of OGR implementation</h3>

OGR imports from/exports to WKT assumes EPSG 9606 convention (position vector 7-parameter),
as <a href="http://proj4.org/parameters.html#towgs84-datum-transformation-to-wgs84">proj.4 does</a>.<p>
When importing from EPSG parameters expressed with EPSG 9607, it does the
appropriate conversion (negating the sign of the rotation terms).<p>

<h2>Longitudes Relative to PRIMEM?</h2>

Another related question is whether longtiudinal projection parameters
(ie. central meridian) are relative to the GEOGCS prime meridian or relative
to greenwich.  While the simplest approach is to treat all longitudes as
relative to Greenwich, I somehow convinced myself at one point that 
the longitudes were intended to be relative to the prime meridian.  However,
a review of 7.3.11 (describing PARAMETER) in the CT 1.0 spec provides no
support for this opinion, and an inspection of EPSG 25700 in Cadcorp also
suggests that the central meridian is relative to greenwich, not the 
prime meridian.<p>

<pre>
PROJCS["Makassar (Jakarta) / NEIEZ",
    GEOGCS["Makassar (Jakarta)",
        DATUM["Makassar",
            SPHEROID["Bessel 1841",6377397.155,299.1528128,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","7004"]],
            TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","6257"]],
        PRIMEM["Jakarta",106.807719444444,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","8908"]],
        UNIT["DMSH",0.0174532925199433,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","9108"]],
        AXIS["Lat","NORTH"],
        AXIS["Long","EAST"],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","4804"]],
    PROJECTION["Mercator_1SP",
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9804"]],
    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
    PARAMETER["central_meridian",110],
    PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.997],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",3900000],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",900000],
    UNIT["metre",1,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],
    AXIS["X","EAST"],
    AXIS["Y","NORTH"],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","25700"]]
</pre>

Based on this, I am proceeding on the assumption that while parameters
are in the units of the GEOGCS they are not relative the GEOGCS prime meridian.
<p>

<h2>Numerical Precision in WKT</h2>

The specification does not address the precision to which values in WKT
should be stored.  Some implementations, such as Oracles apparently, use
rather limited precision for parameters such as Scale Factor making it difficult
to compare coordinate system descriptions or even to get comparible numerical
results.<p>

The best practice is to preserve the original precision as specified in the
source database, such as EPSG where possible.  Given that many systems do not
track precision, at least it is advisable to produce values with the equivalent
of the C "%.16g" format, maintaining 16 digits of precision, capturing most
of the precision of a double precision IEEE floating point value. <p>

<li> ESRI seems to use Equidistant_Cylindrical for what I know as
Equirectangular.
