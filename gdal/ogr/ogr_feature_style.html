1. Overview</H2>
This document defines the way feature style information (i.e. colors, line
width, symbols, etc.) should be handled at the various levels in GDAL's
vector drivers (OGR).
<P>The following GDAL vector drivers have varying levels of support
for feature styles:
<a href="drv_cad.html">DWG (libopencad)</a>,
<a href="drv_dwg.html">DWG (Teigha)</a>,
<a href="drv_dxf.html">DXF</a>,
<a href="drv_libkml.html">KML (libkml)</a>,
<a href="drv_mitab.html">MapInfo</a>,
<a href="drv_dgn.html">MicroStation DGN v7</a> and
<a href="drv_dgnv8.html">DGN v8</a>,
<a href="drv_jml.html">OpenJUMP JML</a> and
<a href="frmt_pdf.html">PDF</a>.
<H3>
1.1 Style is a property of Feature object</H3>
Conceptually, the feature style should be seen as a property of a feature.
Even though some systems store style information in a special attribute,
in GDAL it is more consistent to see the style as a property, just the same
way the geometry of a feature is also a property.
<P>This does not prevent us from storing the style information in an attribute
when writing to some formats that have no provision for styles (e.g. E00).
But then at the time such a dataset is opened through GDAL, the name of
the attribute that contains style information should either be specified
in some metadata, or be specified by the user.
<P>Also, in the SFCOM interface, the style information will be stored in
an attribute just like the geometry is.
<H3>
1.2 Feature Styles can be stored at 2 levels</H3>
The style defines the way a feature should be drawn, but it is very common
to have several features that share the same style. In those cases, instead
of duplicating the style information on each feature, we will provide a
more efficient way to share style information.
<P>There are two levels at which style information can be found:
<UL>
<LI>
A <B>dataset</B> can have a table of pre-defined styles that can then be referred
to by the layers or by the individual features. The mechanism for that is defined
further down in this document.

<LI>
A <B>feature (OGRFeature object)</B> can have its own complete style definition.
Alternatively, a feature can be linked to a style in the dataset's table of styles.
This can save storage space when the same styles are reused often.

</UL>
It should be possible to have style information stored at one or more of
the various levels while working on a given dataset. The level(s) where
the style is actually stored will depend on the most efficient approach
for the format we are dealing with.

<H3>
1.3 Drawing Tools</H3>
We define a small set of drawing tools that are used to build style definitions:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>PEN</B>: For linear styles</LI>

<LI>
<B>BRUSH</B>: For filling areas</LI>

<LI>
<B>SYMBOL</B>: Point symbols</LI>

<LI>
<B>LABEL</B>: For annotations</LI>
</UL>
Each drawing tool can take a number of parameters, all optional. The style
syntax is built in a way that a system that cannot support all possible
parameters can safely skip and ignore the parameters it does not support.
This will also make it easy to extend the specification in the future without
breaking existing code or applications.
<P>A style can use a single tool, or use a combination of one or more tools.
By combining the use of several tools in a style, one can build virtually
any type of graphical representation. For instance, the SYMBOL tool can
be used to place spaced symbols along a line. Also, the LABEL tool can
be used to place text on a point, stretch it along a line, or even, by
combining the PEN tool with the LABEL tool, use the line as a leader to
the text label, and draw the text string on the last vertex of the line.
<P>Of course, few systems can support all that. But the intention here
is to have a style specification that is powerful and flexible enough to
allow all types of formats to exchange style information with the least
possible loss.
<H3>
1.4 Feature attributes can be used by style definitions</H3>
In some cases, it might be useful for a style definition to refer to an
attribute field on the feature for a given tool parameter's value instead
of having a hardcoded value inside the style itself.
<P>Example of this are text angle, text string, etc... these values change
for every single text label, but we can share the rest of the label style
at the layer level if we lookup the angle and text string in an attribute
on each feature.
<P>The syntax of the style string provides a way that any parameter value
can be either a constant value, or a lookup to an attribute field.
<H3>
1.5 Tool parameter units</H3>
Several parameter values can be expressed in different measurement units
depending on the file format you are dealing with. For instance, some systems
express line width, or text height in points, other in pixels, and others
use ground units. In order to accommodate all that, all parameters can be
specified in one of the following units systems:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>g</B>: Map Ground Units (whatever the map coordinate units are)</LI>

<LI>
<B>px</B>: Pixels</LI>

<LI>
<B>pt</B>: Points (1/72 inch)</LI>

<LI>
<B>mm</B>: Millimeters</LI>

<LI>
<B>cm</B>: Centimeters</LI>

<LI>
<B>in</B>: Inches</LI>
</UL>
Some tools will have to be provided at the GDAL client level to simplify
the conversion of any value from one units system to another. This would
imply that the GDAL client has to specify a map scale so that conversions
from ground units to paper/pixel units can be performed.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<H2>
2. Feature Style String</H2>
As was mentioned earlier, styles definitions will usually be stored as
strings, either in a per-layer (or per-dataset) table, or directly in the
features.
<H3>
2.1 Examples</H3>
Here are some example style definition strings:
<UL>
<LI>A 5 pixels wide red line:
<BR><CODE>PEN(c:#FF0000,w:5px)</CODE>

<LI>A polygon filled in blue, with a black outline:
<BR><CODE>BRUSH(fc:#0000FF);PEN(c:#000000)</CODE>

<LI>A point symbol:
<BR><CODE>SYMBOL(c:#00FF00,id:"points.sym-45,ogr-sym-7")</CODE>

<LI>A text label, taking the text string from the "text_attribute" attribute field:
<BR><CODE>LABEL(f:"Times New Roman",s:12pt,t:{text_attribute})"</CODE>
</UL>

Here is what a style table that contains all the above styles could look
like:
<PRE>    road:      PEN(c:#FF0000,w:5px)
    lake:      BRUSH(fc:#0000FF);PEN(c:#000000)
    campsite:  SYMBOL(c:#00FF00,id:"points.sym-45,ogr-sym-7")
    label:     LABEL(f:"Times New Roman",s:12pt,t:{text_attribute})</PRE>

Then individual features can refer to styles from the table above
using the "@" character followed by the style name in their style property.
<P>For instance, a feature with its style set to "@road" would be drawn
as a red line.
<H3>
2.2 Style String Syntax</H3>
Each feature object has a style property (a string):
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD>
<PRE>
  &lt;style_property> = "&lt;style_def>" | "" | "@&lt;style_name>" | "{&lt;field_name>}"</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>&lt;style_def></CODE> is defined later in this section.</LI>

<LI> An empty style string means that the feature's style is unspecified. It
does not indicate that the feature is invisible &ndash; an invisible feature may
be indicated using a fully transparent color, like PEN(c:#00000000).

<LI>
<CODE>@&lt;style_name></CODE> is a reference to a predefined style in the layer or
the dataset's style table. The layer's table is looked up first, and if
style_name is not found there then the dataset's table will be looked up.</LI>

<LI>
Finally, <CODE>{&lt;field_name>}</CODE> means that the style property should be read
from the specified attribute field.</LI>
</UL>
The &lt;style_def> is the real style definition. It is a combination of
1 or more style parts separated by semicolons. Each style_part uses a drawing
tool to define a portion of the complete graphical representation:
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD>
<PRE>
  &lt;style_def> =    &lt;style_part>[;&lt;style_part>[;...]]

  &lt;style_part> =   &lt;tool_name>([&lt;tool_param>[,&lt;tool_param>[,...]]])

  &lt;tool_name> =    name of a drawing tool, for now: PEN | BRUSH | SYMBOL | LABEL

  &lt;tool_param> =   &lt;param_name>:&lt;param_value>

  &lt;param_name> =   see list of parameters names for each drawing tool

  &lt;param_value> =  &lt;value> | &lt;value>&lt;units>

  &lt;value> =        "&lt;string_value>" | &lt;numeric_value> | {&lt;field_name>}

  &lt;units> =        g | px | pt | mm | cm | in</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>By default, style parts are drawn in the order that they appear in the
style_def string unless each part is assigned a different level parameter
value (see the level parameter definition).
<P>All drawing tool parameters are optional. So it is legal to have a style_part
with an empty drawing tool parameter list (e.g. "PEN()"). For each parameter
that does not have any specified value, it is up to the client application
to use its own default value. This document provides advisory default values
for most parameters, but it is not mandatory for an application to use
those default values.
<P>When {&lt;field_name>} is used for a tool_param value, several options
are available with respect to the units. The units can be specified after
the field name as in PEN(c:#FF0000,w:{line_width}pt) or can be left unspecified
as in PEN(c:#FF0000,w:{line_width}). In the first case, the default units
will be points (pt), but if the attribute field line_width contains a value
followed by a units abbreviation (e.g. "5px") then the units specified
in the attribute fields have precedence (in this case pixels). Note that
the attribute field does not have to contain a units value and probably
won't in most cases; it is just an optional feature to be able to override
the default units from inside an attribute field's value.
<H3>
2.3 Pen Tool Parameters</H3>
<B>Applicable geometry types:</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Point: When applied to a point, a PEN tool can only define the color and
the size of the point to draw.</LI>

<LI>
Polyline: This is the most obvious case.</LI>

<LI>
Polygon: Defines the way the outline of a polygon should be drawn.</LI>
</UL>
Here is the current list of PEN tool parameters. While this is sufficient
to cover all the cases that we have encountered so far, new parameters
might be added in the future to handle new types of graphical representation.
Note again that all parameters are optional:

Pen Ids can be either system-specific ids (see further below) or be one

a name, a filename, etc.).<BR>
e.g. "mapinfo-5", or "mysoft-lines.sym-123", or "othersystems-funnyline"
      <P>
System-specific ids are allowed in order to prevent loss of information when
dealing with data from systems that store line patterns in external files
or that have their own pre-defined set of line styles (for instance, to do a MapInfo MIF
to TAB translation without any loss.)
      <P>Examples: <BR>
PEN(c:#00FF00,id:"ogr-pen-0") - simple solid line<BR>
PEN(c:#00FF00,id:"mapinfo-5,ogr-pen-7") - corresponds to MapInfo's Pen #5, and a system that can't understand MapInfo pens falls back on the default "ogr-pen-7" pen (dot-dot line).

comma-delimited list of ids so that an application never has to rely on
understanding system-specific ids.
      <P><IMG SRC="style_ogr_sym.png" STYLE="float: right">
Here is the current list of OGR symbol ids (this could grow over time):<BR>
      <UL>
        <LI>ogr-sym-0: cross (+)
        <LI>ogr-sym-1: diagcross (X)

        <LI>ogr-sym-10: vertical bar (can be rotated using angle attribute to produce diag bar)
      </UL>
      <P>
Like with Pen Ids, system-specific symbol ids are very
likely to be meaningful only to that specific system that created them.
The ids should start with the system's name, followed by a dash (-),
followed by whatever information is meaningful to that system (a number,
a name, a filename, etc.).
      <P>The following conventions will be used for common system-specific symbol ids:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>&quot;bmp-filename.bmp&quot; for Windows BMP symbols
        <LI>&quot;font-sym-%d&quot; for a font symbols,
            where %d is a glyph number inside a font,
            font family is defined by <B>f</B> style field.

  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN=CENTER>s</TD>
    <TD><B>Font Size</B>, expressed as a numeric value with units (g, px, pt, mm, cm, in).
<BR><BR>In the CAD world, font size, or "text height", determines
the height of a capital letter &ndash; what typographers call "cap height".
But in the worlds of typesetting, graphics and cartography, font size
refers to the "em height" of the font, which is taller than the cap height.
This means that text assigned a height of 1 inch in a DXF file will look larger
(often about 45% larger) than 72-point text in a PDF file or
MapInfo map. At present, GDAL vector drivers treat the "s:" style string value as
whichever font size measurement (cap height or em height) is used natively by
that format, which may result in incorrect text sizing when using the ogr2ogr tool.
This parameter could be subject to clearer
specification in the future.</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN=CENTER>t</TD>
    <TD><B>Text String</B> - Can be a constant string, or a reference to an

    <TD ALIGN=CENTER>m</TD>
    <TD><B>Label Placement Mode</B> - How the text is drawn relative to the

<H3>
2.7 Styles Table Format</H3>
For file formats that support tables of styles, then the predefined styles
would be stored in that format.
<P>For file formats that do not support tables of styles, then the style table
could be stored in a text file with a .ofs (OGR Feature Styles)  extension
and the same basename as the dataset.
This would apply to formats like Esri Shapefile.
<P>Here is an example of a .ofs file:
<PRE>
    #OFS-Version: 1.0
    #StyleField: &quot;style&quot;

    DefaultStyle: PEN(c:#000000)
    road:      PEN(c:#FF0000,w:5px)
    lake:      BRUSH(fc:#0000FF);PEN(c:#000000)
    campsite:  SYMBOL(c:#00FF00,id:"points.sym-45,ogr-sym-7")
    label:     LABEL(f:"Times New Roman",s:12pt,t:{text_attribute})</PRE>

<P>
<P>The first line is a signature with a version number, which must be present.
<P>The second line (StyleField: &quot;style&quot;) is the name of the attribute
field in which the Feature Style String is stored for each object in the corresponding layer.  This is optional, if not set, then the objects in the layer will all share the same style defined in DefaultStyle.
<P>The third line (DefaultStyle:...) defines the style that applies by
default to all objects that have no explicit style.
<P>Then the list of style definitions follow.
<P>
<H3>2.8 Using OGR SQL to transfer the style between the data sources</H3>
<P>You can use the <B>OGR_STYLE</B> special field to extract the feature level style,
and ogr2ogr can be used to transfer the style string between data sources according
to the following example:</P>
<PRE>  ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -sql "select *, OGR_STYLE from rivers" rivers.shp rivers.tab</PRE>
<P>Without specifying the length of the style field, the output driver may truncate
the length to a default value. Therefore it may be necessary to specify the target
length manually, like:</P>
<PRE>  ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -sql "select *, CAST(OGR_STYLE AS character(255)) from rivers" rivers.shp rivers.tab</PRE>
<P>OGR is aware of using the OGR_STYLE field if it exists, and OGRFeature::GetStyleString
will return the value of this field if no style string has been specified programmatically.</P>
<P>&nbsp;
<P>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<H2>
3. OGR Support Classes</H2>
<P>The <a href="classOGRFeature.html">OGRFeature class</a> has
member functions <code>GetStyleString</code>, <code>SetStyleString</code> and
<code>SetStyleStringDirectly</code> which may be used to interact with a
feature's style string as a C-style string. Additionally, there are
<code>GetStyleTable</code>, <code>SetStyleTable</code> and
<code>SetStyleTableDirectly</code> for managing style tables as instances of the
<a href="classOGRStyleTable.html">OGRStyleTable class</a>.

<P>The <a href="classOGRLayer.html">OGRLayer class</a> and
<a href="classGDALDataset.html">GDALDataset class</a> also
have <code>GetStyleTable</code>, <code>SetStyleTable</code> and
<code>SetStyleTableDirectly</code> member functions.

<P>To parse style strings, the
<a href="classOGRStyleMgr.html">OGRStyleMgr class</a> is used.
Each style tool in the string is accessed as an instance of the
<a href="classOGRStyleTool.html">OGRStyleTool class</a>. Lastly,
four helper classes exist, one for each tool 
(<a href="classOGRStylePen.html">OGRStylePen</a>,
<a href="classOGRStyleBrush.html">OGRStyleBrush</a>,
<a href="classOGRStyleSymbol.html">OGRStyleSymbol</a>,
<a href="classOGRStyleLabel.html">OGRStyleLabel</a>), 
with each available parameter represented by a getter and setter member function. To
understand these classes better, it may be useful to read the
<a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogr_featurestyle.h">ogr_featurestyle.h</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrfeaturestyle.cpp">ogrfeaturestyle.cpp</a>
code files.

<P>Here is some example C++ code:

<PRE>
   OGRStyleTable oStyleTable;

   OGRStyleMgr *poStyleMgr = new OGRStyleMgr(&amp;oStyleTable);

   // Create a new style in the style table by specifying the whole style string

   }

   oStyleTable->SaveStyleTable("ttt.tbl");


   // Create a new style in the style table by specifying each tool (part) as a string

   poStyleMgr->InitStyleString();
   poStyleMgr->AddPart("PEN(c:#123456,w:10px)");
   poStyleMgr->AddPart("BRUSH(c:345678)");
   poStyleMgr->AddStyle("@Name");
   poStyleMgr->SetFeatureStyleString(poFeature,"@Name",TRUE);

   oStyleTable->SaveStyleTable("ttt.tbl");


   // Create a new style in the style table using the style tool helper classes

   OGRStyleTool *poStylePen = new OGRStylePen;

   poStylePen->SetColor("#123456");
   poStylePen->SetUnit(OGRSTUPixel);
   poStylePen->SetWidth(10.0);
   poStyleMgr->AddPart(poStylePen);

   delete poStylePen;


   // Reading a style

   OGRStyleTool *poStyleTool;

   poStyleMgr->GetStyleString(poFeature);

   for (int iPart = 0; iPart &lt; poStyleMgr->GetPartCount(); iPart++)
   {
      poStyleTool = GetPart(iPart);
      switch (poStyleTool->GetType())
      {
         case OGRSTCPen:
            poStylePen = (OGRStylePen *)poStyleTool;
            pszColor = poStylePen->Color(bDefault);
            if (bDefault == FALSE)
              poStylePen->GetRGBFromString(pszColor, nRed, nGreen,
	                                   nBlue, nTrans);
            else
              // Color not defined

            dfWidth = poStylePen->Width(bDefault);
            if (bDefault == FALSE)
              // Use dfWidth
