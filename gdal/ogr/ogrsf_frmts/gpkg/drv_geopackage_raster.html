<h1>GeoPackage raster</h1>

<p>Starting with GDAL 2.0, this driver implements full read/creation/update of
tables containing raster tiles in the
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/">OGC GeoPackage format standard</a>.
The GeoPackage standard uses a SQLite database file as a generic container, and the standard defines:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expected metadata tables (<code>gpkg_contents</code>,
     <code>gpkg_spatial_ref_sys</code>, <code>gpkg_tile_matrix</code>,
     <code>gpkg_tile_matrix_set</code>, ...)</li>
  <li>Tile format encoding (PNG and JPEG for base specification, WebP as extension) and tiling conventions</li>
  <li>Naming and conventions for extensions</li>
</ul>
<p>This driver reads and writes SQLite files from the file system, so it must be
run by a user with read/write access to the files it is working with.</p>

<p>The driver can also handle GeoPackage vectors. See
<a href="drv_geopackage.html">GeoPackage vector</a> documentation page</p>

<p>Various kind of input datasets can be converted to GeoPackage raster :
<ul>
<li>Single band grey level</li>
<li>Single band with R,G,B or R,G,B,A color table</li>
<li>Two bands: first band with grey level, second band with alpha channel</li>
<li>Three bands: Red, Green, Blue</li>
<li>Four band: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha</li>
</ul>
GeoPackage rasters only support Byte data type.

<p>
All raster extensions standardized by the GeoPackage specification are supported in read and creation :
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>gpkg_webp</i>: when storing WebP tiles, provided that GDAL is compiled against libwebp.</li>
<li><i>gpkg_zoom_other</i>: when resolution of consecutive zoom levels does not vary with a factor of 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening options</h2>

<p>By default, the driver will expose a GeoPackage dataset as a four band (Red,Green,
Blue,Alpha) dataset, which gives the maximum compatibility with the various encodings of
tiles that can be stored. It is possible to specify an explicit number of bands
with the BAND_COUNT opening option.</p>

<p>The driver will use the geographic/projected extent indicated in the
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_contents"><i>gpkg_contents</i></a> table,
and do necessary clipping, if needed, to respect
that extent. However that information being optional, if omitted, the driver
will use the extent provided by the
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_tile_matrix_set"><i>gpkg_tile_matrix_set</i></a>,
which covers the extent at all zoom levels. The user can also specify the USE_TILE_EXTENT=YES
open option to use the actual extent of tiles at the maximum zoom level. Or
it can specify any of MINX/MINY/MAXX/MAXY to have a custom extent.<p>

The following open options are available:
<ul>
<li><b>TABLE</b>=table_name: Name of the table containing the tiles (called
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles_user_tables">"Tile Pyramid User Data Table"</a>
in the GeoPackage specification language). If
the GeoPackage dataset only contains one table, this option is not necessary.
Otherwise, it is required.</li>
<li><b>ZOOM_LEVEL</b>=value: Integer value between 0 and the maximum filled in
the <i>gpkg_tile_matrix</i> table. By default, the driver will select the maximum
zoom level, such as at least one tile at that zoom level is found in the raster table.</li>
<li><b>BAND_COUNT</b>=1/2/3/4: Number of bands of the dataset exposed after opening.
Some conversions will be done when possible and implemented, but this might fail
in some cases, depending on the BAND_COUNT value and the number of bands of the tile.
Defaults to 4 (which is the always safe value).</li>
<li><b>MINX</b>=value: Minimum longitude/easting of the area of interest.</li>
<li><b>MINY</b>=value: Minimum latitude/northing of the area of interest.</li>
<li><b>MAXX</b>=value: Maximum longitude/easting of the area of interest.</li>
<li><b>MAXY</b>=value: Maximum latitude/northing of the area of interest.</li>
<li><b>USE_TILE_EXTENT</b>=YES/NO: Whether to use the extent of actual existing
tiles at the zoom level of the full resolution dataset. Defaults to NO.</li>
<li><b>TILE_FORMAT</b>=PNG_JPEG/PNG/PNG8/JPEG/WEBP: Format used to store tiles. See
<a href="#tile_format">Tile format</a> section. Only used in update mode. Defaults to PNG_JPEG.</li>
<li><b>QUALITY</b>=1-100: Quality setting for JPEG and WEBP compression. Only used in update mode. Default to 75.</li>
<li><b>ZLEVEL</b>=1-9: DEFLATE compression level for PNG tiles. Only used in update mode. Default to 6.</li>
<li><b>DITHER</b>=YES/NO: Whether to use Floyd-Steinberg dithering (for TILE_FORMAT=PNG8).
Only used in update mode. Defaults to NO.</li>
</ul>

Note: open options are typically specified with "-oo name=value" syntax in
most GDAL utilities, or with the GDALOpenEx() API call.

<h2>Creation issues</h2>

<p>Depending of the number of bands of the input dataset and the tile format
selected, the driver will do the necessary conversions to be compatible with the
tile format.</p>

<p>To add several tile tables to a GeoPackage dataset (seen as GDAL subdatasets),
or to add a tile table to an existing vector-only GeoPackage, the generic
APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES creation option must be provided.</p>

<p>Fully transparent tiles will not be written to the database, as allowed by
the format.</p>

<p>The driver implements the Create() and IWriteBlock() methods, so that arbitrary
writing of raster blocks is possible, enabling the direct use of GeoPackage as
the output dataset of utilities such as gdalwarp.</p>

<p>On creation, raster blocks can be written only if the geotransformation
matrix has been set with SetGeoTransform() This is effectively needed to determine
the zoom level of the full resolution dataset based on the pixel resolution, dataset
and tile dimensions.</p>

<p>Technical/implementation note: when a dataset is opened with a non-default area of interest
(i.e. use of MINX,MINY,MAXX,MAXY or USE_TILE_EXTENT open option), or when creating/
opening a dataset with a non-custom tiling scheme, it is possible that GDAL blocks
do not exactly match a single GeoPackage tile. In which case, each GDAL
block will overlap four GeoPackage tiles. This is easily handled on the read side,
but on creation/update side, such configuration could cause numerous decompression/
recompression of tiles to be done, which might cause unnecessary quality loss when using
lossy compression (JPEG, WebP). To avoid that, the driver will create a temporary
database next to the main GeoPackage file to store partial GeoPackage tiles in a
lossless (and uncompressed) way. Once a tile has received data for its four quadrants
and for all the bands (or the dataset is closed or explicitly flushed with FlushCache()),
those uncompressed tiles are definitely transferred to the GeoPackage file with
the appropriate compression. All of this is transparent to the user of GDAL API/utilities</p>

<h3><a id="tile_formats">Tile formats</a></h3>

<h4>Tiled rasters</h4>

<p>GeoPackage can store tiles in different formats, PNG and/or JPEG for the baseline
specification, and WebP for extended GeoPackage. Support for those tile formats
depend if the underlying drivers are available in GDAL, which is generally the
case for PNG and JPEG, but not necessarily for WebP since it requires GDAL to
be compiled against the optional libwebp.<p>

<p>By default, GDAL will use a mix of PNG and JPEG tiles (PNG_JPEG tile format,
or AUTO). PNG tiles will be used
to store tiles that are not completely opaque, either because input dataset has
an alpha channel with non fully opaque content, or because tiles are partial due
to clipping at the right or bottom edges of the raster, or when a dataset is opened
with a non-default area of interest, or with a non-custom tiling scheme. On the
contrary, for fully opaque tiles, JPEG format will be used.</p>

<p>It is possible to select one unique tile format by setting the creation/open
option TILE_FORMAT to one of PNG, JPEG or WEBP. When using JPEG, the alpha channel
will not be stored. When using WebP, the
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_tiles_webp"><i>gpkg_webp</i></a>
extension will be registered. The lossy compression of WebP is used.
Note that a recent enough libwebp
(&gt;=0.1.4) must be used to support alpha channel in WebP tiles.</p>

<p>PNG8 can be selected to use 8-bit PNG with a color table up to 256 colors.
On creation, an optimized color table is computed for each tile. The DITHER
option can be set to YES to use Floyd/Steinberg dithering algorithm, which
spreads the quantization error on neighbouring pixels for better rendering (note
however than when zooming in, this can cause non desirable visual artifacts).
Setting it to YES will generally cause less effective compression.
Note that at that time, such an 8-bit PNG formulation is only used for fully opaque tiles,
as the median-cut algorithm currently implemented to compute the optimal color
table does not support alpha channel (even if PNG8 format would potentially allow
color table with transparency). So when selecting PNG8, non fully opaque tiles
will be stored as 32-bit PNG.</p>

<h4>Tiled gridded elevation data</h4>

<p><b>WARNING</b>: the tiled gridded extension
<a href="http://geopackage.blogspot.com/2017/05/good-news-bad-news.html">
has been delayed</a> by the OGC architecture
board and will probably be subject to further changes. So interoperability with
the final specification is not guaranteed (and unlikely).</p>

<p>Since GeoPackage v1.2 and GDAL 2.2,
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_tiled_gridded_elevation_data">
tiled gridded elevation data</a> can be stored using
PNG unsigned 16bit tiles (with potential offset and scaling so as to be able
to represent floating point data) or TIFF 32-bit floating-point LZW compressed
tiles.</p>

<p>When converting a GDAL Int16 or UInt16 dataset, PNG tiles will be used.
When converting a GDAL Float32 dataset, TIFF tiles will be used by default, unless
PNG is explicitly selected, in which case scaling and offsetting will be
automatically computed for each tile.</p>

<h3><a id="tiling_schemes">Tiling schemes</a></h3>

<p>
By default, conversion to GeoPackage will create a custom tiling scheme, such
that the input dataset can be losslessly converted, both at the pixel and
georeferencing level (if using a lossless tile format such as PNG). That
tiling scheme is such that its origin (<i>min_x</i>, <i>max_y</i>) in the
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_tile_matrix_set"><i>gpkg_tile_matrix_set</i></a>
table perfectly matches the top left corner of the dataset, and the selected
resolution (<i>pixel_x_size</i>, <i>pixel_y_size</i>) at the computed maximum zoom_level of the
<a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_tile_matrix"><i>gpkg_tile_matrix</i></a> table will
match the pixel width and height of the raster.
</p>
<p>However to ease interoperability with other implementations, and enable use
of GeoPackage with tile servicing software, it is possible to select a predefined
tiling scheme that has world coverage. The available tiling schemes are :</p>
<ul>
<li><i>GoogleCRS84Quad</i>, as described in
<a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=35326">OGC 07-057r7
WMTS 1.0</a> specification, Annex E.3. That tiling schemes consists of a single
256x256 tile at its zoom level 0, in EPSG:4326 CRS, with extent in longitude and
latitude in the range [-180,180]. Consequently, at zoom level 0, 64 lines are
unused at the top and bottom of that tile. This may cause issues with some
implementations of the specification, and there are some ambiguities about the
exact definition of this tiling scheme. Using InspireCRS84Quad/PseudoTMS_GlobalGeodetic
instead is therefore recommended.</li>
<li><i>GoogleMapsCompatible</i>, as described in WMTS 1.0 specification, Annex E.4.
That tiling schemes consists of a single 256x256 tile at its zoom level 0,
in EPSG:3857 CRS, with extent in easting and northing in the range
[-20037508.34,20037508.34].</li>
<li><i>InspireCRS84Quad</i>, as described in
<a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Network_Services/TechnicalGuidance_ViewServices_v3.0.pdf">
<i>Inspire View Services</i></a>.
That tiling schemes consists of two 256x256 tiles at its zoom level 0, in
EPSG:4326 CRS, with extent in longitude in the range [-180,180] and in latitude
in the range [-90,90].</li>
<li><i>PseudoTMS_GlobalGeodetic</i>, based on the
<a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification#global-geodetic">
<i>global-geodetic</i></a> profile of OSGeo TMS (Tile Map Service) specification.
This has exactly the same definition as <i>InspireCRS84Quad</i> tiling scheme. Note
however that full interoperability with TMS is not
possible due to the origin of numbering of tiles being the top left corner in
GeoPackage (consistently with WMTS convention), whereas TMS uses the bottom left
corner as origin.</li>
<li><i>PseudoTMS_GlobalMercator</i>, based on the
<a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification#global-mercator">
<i>global-mercator</i></a> profile of OSGeo TMS (Tile Map Service) specification.
That tiling schemes consists of four 256x256 tiles at its zoom level 0,
in EPSG:3857 CRS, with extent extent in easting and northing in the range
[-20037508.34,20037508.34]. The same remark as with PseudoTMS_GlobalGeodetic applies
regarding interoperability with TMS.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all the above tiling schemes, consecutive zoom levels defer by a resolution
of a factor of two.</p>

<h3><a>Nodata value</a></h3>

<p>The concept of the nodata value is only supported for tiled gridded elevation
datasets. For regular tiled rasters, the alpha band must rather be used.</p>

<p>For Float32 datasets with TIFF tiles, the concepts of nodata in GDAL
and null_value in the GeoPackage internasl perfectly match.</p>

<p>For Int16, UInt16 or Float32 with PNG tiles, GDAL will generally remap the
input nodata value to another value.</p>

<p>On writing, for PNG tiles, the behaviour is the following one:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>GDAL data type</td><td>Input GDAL nodata value</td><td>null_value in GPKG gpkg_2d_gridded_coverage_ancillary</td></tr>
<tr><td>Int16</td><td>Any</td><td>65535</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>X (if coverage offset == 0 and coverage scale == 1)</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Float32</td><td>Any</td><td>65535</td></tr>
</table>

<p>On reading, for PNG tiles, the behaviour is the following one:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>GDAL data type</td><td>null_value in GPKG gpkg_2d_gridded_coverage_ancillary</td><td>Exposed GDAL nodata value</td></tr>
<tr><td>Int16</td><td>&gt;= 32768</td><td>-32768</td></tr>
<tr><td>Int16</td><td>X &lt;= 32767</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Float32</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Thus, perfect roundtripping is achieved in the following cases:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>GDAL data type</td><td>GDAL nodata value</td><td>null_value in GPKG gpkg_2d_gridded_coverage_ancillary</td></tr>
<tr><td>Int16</td><td>-32768</td><td>65535</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>X (if coverage offset == 0 and coverage scale == 1)</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Float32</td><td>65535</td><td>65535</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Creation options</h3>

<p>The following creation options are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>RASTER_TABLE</b>=string. Name of tile user table. By default, based on
the filename (i.e. if filename is foo.gpkg, the table will be called "foo").</li>
<li><b>APPEND_SUBDATASET</b>=YES/NO: If set to YES, an existing GeoPackage
will not be priorly destroyed, such as to be able to add new content to it. Defaults to NO.</li>
<li><b>RASTER_IDENTIFIER</b>=string. Human-readable identifier (e.g. short name), put
in the <i>identifier</i> column of the <i>gpkg_contents</i> table.</li>
<li><b>RASTER_DESCRIPTION</b>=string. Human-readable description, put
in the <i>description</i> column of the <i>gpkg_contents</i> table.</li>
<li><b>BLOCKSIZE</b>=integer. Block size in width and height in pixels.
Defaults to 256. Maximum supported is 4096. Should not be set when using a non-custom TILING_SCHEME.</li>
<li><b>BLOCKXSIZE</b>=integer. Block width in pixels.
Defaults to 256. Maximum supported is 4096.</li>
<li><b>BLOCKYSIZE</b>=integer. Block height in pixels.
Defaults to 256. Maximum supported is 4096.</li>
<li><b>TILE_FORMAT</b>=PNG_JPEG/PNG/PNG8/JPEG/WEBP/TIFF/AUTO: Format used to store tiles. See
<a href="#tile_formats">Tile formats</a> section. Defaults to AUTO.</li>
<li><b>QUALITY</b>=1-100: Quality setting for JPEG and WEBP compression. Default to 75.</li>
<li><b>ZLEVEL</b>=1-9: DEFLATE compression level for PNG tiles. Default to 6.</li>
<li><b>DITHER</b>=YES/NO: Whether to use Floyd-Steinberg dithering (for TILE_FORMAT=PNG8).
Defaults to NO.</li>
<li><b>TILING_SCHEME</b>=CUSTOM/GoogleCRS84Quad/GoogleMapsCompatible/InspireCRS84Quad/PseudoTMS_GlobalGeodetic/PseudoTMS_GlobalMercator.
See <a href="#tiling_schemes">Tiling schemes</a> section. Defaults to CUSTOM.</li>
<li><b>ZOOM_LEVEL_STRATEGY</b>=AUTO/LOWER/UPPER. Strategy to determine zoom level.
Only used for TILING_SCHEME is different from CUSTOM. LOWER will select the
zoom level immediately below the theoretical computed non-integral zoom level,
leading to subsampling. On the contrary, UPPER will select the immediately above
zoom level, leading to oversampling. Defaults to AUTO which selects the closest
zoom level.</li>
<li><b>RESAMPLING</b>=NEAREST/BILINEAR/CUBIC/CUBICSPLINE/LANCZOS/MODE/AVERAGE.
Resampling algorithm. Only used for TILING_SCHEME is different from CUSTOM. Defaults
to BILINEAR.</li>
<li><b>PRECISION</b>=floating_point_value_in_vertical_units: Smallest significant value.
Only used for tile gridded elevation data. Defaults to 1.</li>
<li><b>VERSION</b>=AUTO/1.0/1.1/1.2: (GDAL &gt;= 2.2) Set GeoPackage version
(for application_id and user_version fields). In AUTO mode, this will be equivalent
to 1.0, unless a tile gridded elevation dataset, or a non-spatial
table (using the 'attributes' data type) is created, in which case 1.2 will be used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overviews</h2>

<p>gdaladdo / BuildOverviews() can be used to compute overviews. Power-of-two
overview factors (2,4,8,16,...) should be favored to be conformant with the
baseline GeoPackage specification. Use of other overview factors will work with the GDAL
driver, and cause the <a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_zoom_other_intervals">
<i>gpkg_zoom_other</i></a> extension to be registered, but
that could potentially cause interoperability problems with other
implementations that do not support that extension.</p>

<p>Overviews can also be cleared with the -clean option of gdaladdo (or
BuildOverviews() with nOverviews=0)</p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

<p>GDAL uses the standardized <a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_metadata_table">
<code>gpkg_metadata</code></a> and <a href="http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_metadata_reference_table">
<code>gpkg_metadata_reference</code></a> tables to read and write metadata.</p>

<p>GDAL metadata, from the default metadata domain and possibly other metadata
domains, is serialized in a single XML document, conformant with the format used
in GDAL PAM (Persistent Auxiliary Metadata) .aux.xml files, and registered with
md_scope=dataset and md_standard_uri=http://gdal.org in gpkg_metadata. In
gpkg_metadata_reference, this entry is referenced with a reference_scope=table and
table_name={name of the raster table}</p>

<p>It is possible to read and write metadata that applies to the global GeoPackage,
and not only to the raster table, by using the <i>GEOPACKAGE</i> metadata
domain.</p>

<p>Metadata not originating from GDAL can be read by the driver and will be
exposed as metadata items with keys of the form GPKG_METADATA_ITEM_XXX and
values the content of the <i>metadata</i> columns of the gpkg_metadata table.
Update of such metadata is not currently supported through GDAL interfaces (
although it can be through direct SQL commands).</p>

<p>The specific DESCRIPTION and IDENTIFIER metadata item of the default metadata
domain can be used in read/write to read from/update the corresponding columns of
the gpkg_contents table.</p>

<p>You can set the CREATE_METADATA_TABLES configuration option to NO to avoid
creating and filling the metadata tables.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>
