<h1>INGRES</h1>

<p>This driver implements read and write access for spatial data in
<a href="http://www.actian.com/products/ingres/geospatial/">INGRES</a> database tables. This
functionality was introduced in GDAL/OGR 1.6.0. </p>

<p>When opening a database, its name should be specified in the form
"@driver=ingres,[host=<i>host</i>, instance=<i>instance</i>],dbname=<i>[vnode::]dbname</i>
[,options]". where the options can
include comma separated
items like "host=*ip_address*","instance=*instance*", "username=*userid*", "password=*password*",
"effuser=*database_user*", "dbpwd=*database_passwd*", "timeout=*timeout*",
"tables=table1/table2".</p>

<p><b>The driver and dbname values are required, while
the rest are optional.</b> If username and password are not provided an attempt
is made to authenticate as the current OS user.</p>

<p>If the host and instance options are both specified,
the username and password *must* be supplied as it creates a temporary
<a href=http://docs.actian.com/ingres/10.0/command-reference-guide/1207-dynamic-vnode-specificationconnect-to-remote-node>dynamic vnode connection</a>.
The default protocol is TCP/IP. If any other protocol is expected to be used, a pre-built vnode is preferable.
If vnode and these two options are passed at the same time, an error will occur.
</p>

<p>The option effuser and dbpwd are mapped to the real user name and password needs to be authorized in dbms, compared to the
username and password which are used for OS level authorization.</p>

Examples:
<pre>
  @driver=ingres,host=192.168.0.1, instance=II, dbname=test,userid=warmerda,password=test,effuser=frank, dbpwd=123, tables=usa/canada

  @driver=ingres,host=192.168.0.1, instance=II, dbname=test,userid=warmerda,password=test,tables=usa/canada

  @driver=ingres,dbname=test,userid=warmerda,password=test,tables=usa/canada

  @driver=ingres,dbname=test,userid=warmerda,password=test,tables=usa/canada

  @driver=ingres,dbname=test,userid=warmerda,password=test,tables=usa/canada

  @driver=ingres,dbname=server::mapping

  @driver=ingres,dbname=mapping
</pre>

<p>
If the tables list is not provided, an attempt is made to enumerate all
non-system tables as layers, otherwise only the listed tables are represented
as layers. This option is primarily useful when a database has a lot of
tables, and scanning all their schemas would take a significant amount of
time.</p>

<p>If an integer field exists in a table that is named "ogr_fid" it will be
used as the FID, otherwise FIDs will be assigned sequentially. This can
result in different FIDs being assigned to a given record/feature depending
on the spatial and attribute query filters in effect at a given time.</p>

<p>By default, SQL statements are passed directly to the INGRES database
engine. It's also possible to request the driver to handle SQL commands
with <a href="ogr_sql.html">OGR SQL</a> engine,
by passing <strong>"OGRSQL"</strong> string to the ExecuteSQL()
method, as name of the SQL dialect.</p>

<p>
The INGRES driver supports OGC SFSQL 1.1 compliant spatial types and functions,
including types: POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON, MULTI* versions, and GEOMETRYCOLLECTION.
</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li> No fast spatial index is used when reading, so spatial filters are
implemented by reading and parsing all records, and then discarding those
that do not satisfy the spatial filter.<p>
</ul>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The INGRES driver does not support creation of new datasets (a database
within INGRES), but it does allow creation of new layers (tables) within an
existing database instance.<P>

<ul>

<li>
The INGRES driver makes no allowances for character encodings at this time.<p>

<li>
The INGRES driver is not transactional at this time.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Layer Creation Options</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>OVERWRITE</b>: This may be "YES" to force an existing layer of the
        desired name to be destroyed before creating the requested layer.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>LAUNDER</b>: This may be "YES" to force new fields created on this
        layer to have their field names "laundered" into a form more
        compatible with MySQL. This converts to lower case and converts
        some special characters like "-" and "#" to "_". If "NO" exact names
        are preserved. The default value is "YES".
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>PRECISION</b>: This may be "TRUE" to attempt to preserve field
        widths and precisions for the creation and reading of MySQL layers.
        The default value is "TRUE".
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>GEOMETRY_NAME</b>: This option specifies the name of the
        geometry column. The default value is "SHAPE".
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>INGRES_FID</b>: This option specifies the name of the FID column.
        The default value is "OGR_FID"
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>GEOMETRY_TYPE</b>: Specifies the object type for the geometry
        column. It may be one of POINT, LSEG, LINE, LONG LINE, POLYGON, or
        LONG POLYGON. By default POINT, LONG LINE or LONG POLYGON are used
        depending on the layer type.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Older Versions</h2>
<p>The INGRES GDAL driver also includes support for old INGRES spatial types,
  but these are not enabled by default. It enable these, the input <i>configure</i>
  script needs to include pointers to libraries used by the older version:
  <pre>INGRES_LIB="-L$II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib \
         $II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib/iiclsadt.o \
         $II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib/iiuseradt.o \
         -liiapi.1 -lcompat.1 -lq.1 -lframe.1"
