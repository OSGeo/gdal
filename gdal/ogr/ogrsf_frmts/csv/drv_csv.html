<h1>Comma Separated Value (.csv)</h1>

<p>OGR supports reading and writing primarily non-spatial tabular data stored in
text CSV files.  CSV files are a common interchange format between
software packages supporting tabular data and are also easily produced
manually with a text editor or with end-user written scripts or programs.</p>

<p>While in theory .csv files could have any extension, in order to
auto-recognise the format OGR only supports CSV files ending with the
extension ".csv".  The datasource name may be either a single CSV file
or point to a directory.  For a directory to be recognised as a .csv datasource
at least half the files in the directory need to have the extension .csv.
One layer (table) is produced from each .csv file accessed.</p>

<p> Starting with GDAL 1.8.0, for files structured as CSV, but not ending with
.CSV extension, the 'CSV:' prefix can be added before the filename to force
loading by the CSV driver.</p>

<p>The OGR CSV driver supports reading and writing. Because the CSV format
has variable length text lines, reading is done sequentially. Reading
features in random order will generally be very slow. OGR CSV layer might
have a coordinate system stored in a .prj file (see GeoCSV specification).  When reading a field named "WKT" is assumed
to contain WKT geometry, but also is treated as a regular field.
The OGR CSV driver returns all attribute columns as string data types
if no field type information file (with .csvt extension) is
available.</p>

<p>Limited type recognition can be done for Integer, Real, String, Date
(YYYY-MM-DD), Time (HH:MM:SS+nn), DateTime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+nn) columns
through a descriptive file with the same name as the CSV file, but a .csvt extension.
In a single line the types for each column have to be listed with double quotes and
be comma separated (e.g., "Integer","String"). It is also possible to specify
explicitly the width and precision of each column, e.g. "Integer(5)","Real(10.7)","String(15)".
The driver will then use these types as specified for the csv columns.
Starting with GDAL 2.0, subtypes can be passed between parenthesis, such as
"Integer(Boolean)", "Integer(Int16)" and "Real(Float32)". Starting with GDAL 2.1,
accordingly with the <a href="http://giswiki.hsr.ch/GeoCSV">GeoCSV specification</a>,
the "CoordX" or "Point(X)" type can be used to specify a column with longitude/easting values,
"CoordY" or "Point(Y)" for latitude/northing values and "WKT" for geometries encoded in WKT </p>

<p>Starting with GDAL 2.0, automatic field type guessing can also be done if
specifying the open options described in the below "Open options" section.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>CSV files have one line for each feature (record) in the layer (table).
The attribute field values are separated by commas. At least two fields
per line must be present. Lines may be terminated by a DOS (CR/LF) or
Unix (LF) style line terminators. Each record should have the same number
of fields. The driver will also accept a semicolon, a tabulation or a space
(GDAL &gt;= 2.0 for the later) character as field separator . This autodetection will work only
if there's no other potential separator on the first line of the CSV file.
Otherwise it will default to comma as separator.</p>

<p>Complex attribute values (such as those containing commas, quotes or newlines)
may be placed in double quotes. Any occurrences of double quotes within
the quoted string should be doubled up to "escape" them.</p>

<p>By default, the driver attempts to treat the first line of the file as a list of field
names for all the fields. However, if one or more of the names is all
numeric it is assumed that the first line is actually data values and
dummy field names are generated internally (field_1 through field_n) and
the first record is treated as a feature. Starting with GDAL 1.9.0
numeric values are treated as field names if they are enclosed in double quotes.
Starting with GDAL 2.1, this behaviour can be modified via the HEADERS open option.
</p>

<p>All CSV files are treated as UTF-8 encoded. Starting with GDAL 1.9.0, a Byte
Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file will be parsed correctly. From 1.9.2,
The option WRITE_BOM can be used to create a file with a Byte Order Mark, which can
improve compatibility with some software (particularly Excel).
</p>

Example (employee.csv):
<pre>
ID,Salary,Name,Comments
132,55000.0,John Walker,"The ""big"" cheese."
133,11000.0,Jane Lake,Cleaning Staff
</pre>

<p>Note that the Comments value for the first data record is placed in
double quotes because the value contains quotes, and those quotes have
to be doubled up so we know we haven't reached the end of the quoted string
yet.</p>

<p>Many variations of textual input are sometimes called Comma Separated
Value files, including files without commas, but fixed column widths,
those using tabs as separators or those with other auxiliary data defining
field types or structure. This driver does not attempt to support all
such files, but instead to support simple .csv files that can be
auto-recognised. Scripts or other mechanisms can generally be used to convert
other variations into a form that is compatible with the OGR CSV driver.</p>

<h2>Reading CSV containing spatial information</h2>

<h3>Building point geometries</h3>

<p>Consider the following CSV file (test.csv):
<pre>
Latitude,Longitude,Name
48.1,0.25,"First point"
49.2,1.1,"Second point"
47.5,0.75,"Third point"
</pre>
</p>

<p>Starting with GDAL 2.1, it is possible to directly specify the potential
names of the columns that can contain X/longitude and Y/latitude with the
X_POSSIBLE_NAMES and Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES open option.</p>

<p><i>ogrinfo -ro -al test.csv -oo X_POSSIBLE_NAMES=Lon* -oo Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES=Lat* -oo KEEP_GEOM_COLUMNS=NO</i> will return :</p>
<pre>
OGRFeature(test):1
  Name (String) = First point
  POINT (0.25 48.1)

OGRFeature(test):2
  Name (String) = Second point
  POINT (1.1 49.2)

OGRFeature(test):3
  Name (String) = Third point
  POINT (0.75 47.5)
</pre>

<p>Otherwise, if one
or several columns contain a geometry definition encoded as WKT, WKB (encoded
in hexadecimal) or GeoJSON, the name of such column(s) the GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES open option.</p>

<p>For older versions, it is possible to extract spatial information (points) from a CSV file
which has columns for the X and Y coordinates, through the use of the
<a href="drv_vrt.html">VRT</a> driver.</p>

You can write the associated VRT file (test.vrt):
<pre>
&lt;OGRVRTDataSource&gt;
    &lt;OGRVRTLayer name="test"&gt;
        &lt;SrcDataSource&gt;test.csv&lt;/SrcDataSource&gt;
        &lt;GeometryType&gt;wkbPoint&lt;/GeometryType&gt;
        &lt;LayerSRS&gt;WGS84&lt;/LayerSRS&gt;
        &lt;GeometryField encoding="PointFromColumns" x="Longitude" y="Latitude"/&gt;
    &lt;/OGRVRTLayer&gt;
&lt;/OGRVRTDataSource&gt;
</pre>
</p>

and <i>ogrinfo -ro -al test.vrt</i> will return :
<pre>
OGRFeature(test):1
  Latitude (String) = 48.1
  Longitude (String) = 0.25
  Name (String) = First point
  POINT (0.25 48.1 0)

OGRFeature(test):2
  Latitude (String) = 49.2
  Longitude (String) = 1.1
  Name (String) = Second point
  POINT (1.1 49.200000000000003 0)

OGRFeature(test):3
  Latitude (String) = 47.5
  Longitude (String) = 0.75
  Name (String) = Third point
  POINT (0.75 47.5 0)
</pre>

<h3>Building line geometries</h3>

<p>Consider the following CSV file (test.csv):
<pre>
way_id,pt_id,x,y
1,1,2,49
1,2,3,50
2,1,-2,49
2,2,-3,50
</pre>
</p>

With a GDAL build with Spatialite enabled,

<i>ogrinfo test.csv -dialect SQLite -sql "SELECT way_id, MakeLine(MakePoint(CAST(x AS float),CAST(y AS float))) FROM test GROUP BY way_id"</i> will return :
<pre>
OGRFeature(SELECT):0
  way_id (String) = 1
  LINESTRING (2 49,3 50)

OGRFeature(SELECT):1
  way_id (String) = 2
  LINESTRING (-2 49,-3 50)
</pre>


<h2>Open options</h2>

Starting with GDAL 2.0, the following open options can be specified
(typically with the -oo name=value parameters of ogrinfo or ogr2ogr):
<ul>
<li><b>MERGE_SEPARATOR</b>=YES/NO (defaults to NO). Setting it to YES will
enable merging consecutive separators. Mostly useful when it is the space
character.</li>
<li><b>AUTODETECT_TYPE</b>=YES/NO (defaults to NO). Setting it to YES will
enable auto-detection of field data types. If while reading the records
(beyond the records used for autodetection), a value is found to not correspond
to the autodetected data type, a warning will be emitted and the field will be
emptied.</li>
<li><b>KEEP_SOURCE_COLUMNS</b>=YES/NO (default NO) keep a copy of the original
columns where the guessing is active, and the guessed type is different from
string. The name of the original columns will be suffixed with "_original".
This flag should be used only when AUTODETECT_TYPE=YES.</li>
<li><b>AUTODETECT_WIDTH</b>=YES/NO/STRING_ONLY (defaults to NO). Setting it to
YES to detect the width of string and integer fields, and the width and precision
of real fields. Setting it to STRING_ONLY restricts to string fields. Setting it
to NO select default size and width. If while reading the records (beyond the
records used for autodetection), a value is found to not correspond to the
autodetected width/precision, a warning will be emitted and the field will be
emptied.</li>
<li><b>AUTODETECT_SIZE_LIMIT</b>=size to specify the number of bytes to inspect
to determine the data type and width/precision. The default will be 100000.
Setting 0 means inspecting the whole file.  Note : specifying a value over 1 MB
(or 0 if the file is larger than 1MB) will prevent reading from standard input.</li>
<li><b>QUOTED_FIELDS_AS_STRING</b>=YES/NO (default NO). Only used if AUTODETECT_TYPE=YES.
Whether to enforce quoted fields as string fields when set to YES. Otherwise,
by default, the content of quoted fields will be tested for real, integer, etc...
data types.</li>
<li><b>X_POSSIBLE_NAMES</b>=list_of_names. (GDAL &gt;= 2.1) Comma separated list of
possible names for X/longitude coordinate of a point. Each name might be a pattern
using the star character in starting and/or ending position. E.g.: prefix*, *suffix or *middle*.
The values in the column must be floating point values.
X_POSSIBLE_NAMES and Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES must be both specified and a matching for
each must be found in the columns of the CSV file. Only one geometry column per
layer might be built when using X_POSSIBLE_NAMES/Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES.</li>
<li><b>Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES</b>=list_of_names. (GDAL &gt;= 2.1) Comma separated list of
possible names for Y/latitude coordinate of a point. Each name might be a pattern
using the star character in starting and/or ending position. E.g.: prefix*, *suffix or *middle*.
The values in the column must be floating point values.
X_POSSIBLE_NAMES and Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES must be both specified and a matching for
each must be found in the columns of the CSV file.</li>
<li><b>Z_POSSIBLE_NAMES</b>=list_of_names. (GDAL &gt;= 2.1) Comma separated list of
possible names for Z/elevation coordinate of a point. Each name might be a pattern
using the star character in starting and/or ending position. E.g.: prefix*, *suffix or *middle*.
The values in the column must be floating point values.
Only taken into account in combination with X_POSSIBLE_NAMES and Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES.</li>
<li><b>GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES</b>=list_of_names. (GDAL &gt;= 2.1) Comma separated list of
possible names for geometry columns that contain geometry definitions encoded as
WKT, WKB (in hexadecimal form, potentially in PostGIS 2.0 extended WKB) or GeoJSON. Each name might be a pattern
using the star character in starting and/or ending position. E.g.: prefix*, *suffix or *middle*</li>
<li><b>KEEP_GEOM_COLUMNS</b>=YES/NO (default YES) Expose the detected X,Y,Z or geometry columns
as regular attribute fields.</li>
<li><b>HEADERS</b>=YES/NO/AUTO (default AUTO) (GDAL &gt;= 2.1) Whether the first line of the file
contains column names or not. When set to AUTO, GDAL will assume the first line is column names if none
of the values are strictly numeric.
<li><b>EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL</b>=YES/NO (default NO) (GDAL &gt;= 2.1)
Whether to consider empty strings as null fields on reading'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

<p>The driver supports creating new databases (as a directory
of .csv files), adding new .csv files to an existing directory or .csv
files or appending features to an existing .csv table. Starting with GDAL 2.1,
deleting or replacing existing features, or adding/modifying/deleting fields is
supported, provided the modifications done are small enough to be stored in RAM
temporarily before flushing to disk.</p>

<p>Layer Creation options:

<ul>
<li><b>LINEFORMAT</b>: By default when creating new .csv files they are created with the line
termination conventions of the local platform (CR/LF on win32 or
LF on all other systems).  This may be overridden through use of the
LINEFORMAT layer creation option which may have a value of <b>CRLF</b>
(DOS format) or <b>LF</b> (Unix format).</li><p>
<li><b>GEOMETRY</b> (Starting with GDAL 1.6.0): By default, the geometry of a feature written to a .csv
file is discarded. It is possible to export the geometry in its WKT representation by specifying
GEOMETRY=<b>AS_WKT</b>. It is also possible to export point geometries into their X,Y,Z components (different
columns in the csv file) by specifying GEOMETRY=<b>AS_XYZ</b>, GEOMETRY=<b>AS_XY</b> or GEOMETRY=<b>AS_YX</b>.
The geometry column(s) will be prepended to the columns with the attributes values.</li><p>
<li><b>CREATE_CSVT</b>=YES/NO (Starting with GDAL 1.7.0): Create the associated .csvt file (see above paragraph)
to describe the type of each column of the layer and its optional width and precision. Default value : NO</li><p>
<li><b>SEPARATOR</b>=COMMA/SEMICOLON/TAB/SPACE (Starting with GDAL 1.7.0): Field separator character. Default value : COMMA</li><p>
<li><b>WRITE_BOM</b>=YES/NO (Starting with GDAL 1.9.2): Write a UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start of the file. Default value : NO</li><p>
<lib><b>GEOMETRY_NAME</b>=name (Starting with GDAL 2.1): Name of geometry column. Only used if GEOMETRY=AS_WKT. Defaults to WKT</li><p>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>VSI Virtual File System API support</h2>

(Some features below might require OGR &gt;= 1.9.0)<p>

The driver supports reading and writing to files managed by VSI Virtual File System API, which include
"regular" files, as well as files in the /vsizip/ (read-write) , /vsigzip/ (read-only) , /vsicurl/ (read-only) domains.<p>

Writing to /dev/stdout or /vsistdout/ is also supported.<p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li> This example shows using ogr2ogr to transform a shapefile with point geometry into a .csv file with the X,Y,Z coordinates of the points as first columns in the .csv file
<pre>ogr2ogr -f CSV output.csv input.shp -lco GEOMETRY=AS_XYZ</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Particular datasources</h2>

The CSV driver can also read files whose structure is close to CSV files :
<ul>
<li>Airport data files NfdcFacilities.xls, NfdcRunways.xls, NfdcRemarks.xls and NfdcSchedules.xls
    found on tha <a href="http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/menu/index.cfm">FAA website</a> (OGR &gt;= 1.8.0)</li>
<li>Files from the <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm">USGS GNIS</a> (Geographic Names Information System) (OGR &gt;= 1.9.0)</li>
<li>The allCountries file from <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a> (OGR &gt;= 1.9.0 for direct import)</li>
<li><a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?file=read_me.pdf">Eurostat .TSV files</a> (OGR &gt;= 1.10.0)</li>
</ul>
