<h1>Microstation DGN v8</h1>

Available since GDAL 2.2<p>

Microstation DGN files from Microstation version 8.0
are supported for reading and writing. Each model of the file is
represented by a OGR layer.<p>

This driver requires to be built against the (non open source)
Open Design Alliance Teiga library.<p>

DGN files are considered to have no georeferencing information through OGR.
Features will all have the following generic attributes:

<ul>
<li> Type: The integer type code as listed below in supported elements.
<li> Level: The DGN level number.
<li> GraphicGroup: The graphic group number.
<li> ColorIndex: The color index from the dgn palette.
<li> Weight: The drawing weight (thickness) for the element.
<li> Style: The style value for the element.
</ul>

<h2>Supported Elements</h2>

The following element types are supported in reading:<p>

<ul>
<li> Cell Header (2): used for polygons with holes
<li> Line (3): Line (2 points) geometry.
<li> Line String (4): Multi segment line geometry.
<li> Shape (6): Polygon geometry.
<li> TextNode (7): Container of Text elements.
<li> Curve (11): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> ComplexString (12): Treated as line string or compound curve.
<li> ComplexShape (14): Treated as polygon or curve polygon.
<li> Ellipse (15): Approximated as a line geometry or a circular string.
<li> Arc (16): Approximated as a line geometry or a circular string.
<li> Text (17): Treated as a point geometry.
<li> B-Spline (21): Treated as a line geometry.
<li> PointString (22): Treatead as multi point.
<li> Shared cell reference (35): Treated as point.
</ul>

Generally speaking any concept of complex objects, and cells as associated
components is lost.  Each component of a complex object or cell is treated
as a independent feature.<p>

<h2>Styling Information</h2>

Some drawing information about features can be extracted from the ColorIndex,
Weight and Style generic attributes; however, for all features an OGR
style string has been prepared with the values encoded in ready-to-use form
for applications supporting OGR style strings.<p>

The various kinds of linear geometries will carry style information indicating
the color, thickness and line style (i.e. dotted, solid, etc).<p>

Polygons (Shape elements) will carry styling information for the edge as well
as a fill color if provided.  Fill patterns are not supported.<p>

Text elements will contain the text, angle, color and size information
(expressed in ground units) in the style string.<p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

The various metadata items that can be set in the DGN header with the dataset
creation options (see below) can be retrieved in the "DGN" metadata domain.

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

DGN files may be written with OGR with  limitations:<P>

<ul>
<li> Output features have the usual fixed DGN attributes.  Attempts to create
any other fields will fail.<p>

<li> Translation from OGR feature style strings back into DGN representation information
is limited to a few properties of LABEL (text, font name, size, angle, color), PEN (color)
and BRUSH (fill color) tools. <p>

<li> POINT geometries that are not text (Text is NULL, and the feature
style string is not a LABEL) will be translated as a degenerate (0 length)
line element. <p>

<li> Geometries which fall outside the "design plane" of the seed file will
be discarded, or corrupted in unpredictable ways.<p>

</ul>

The dataset creation supports the following options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>SEED=</b><i>filename</i>: Specify the seed file to use.<p>

<li> <b>COPY_SEED_FILE_COLOR_TABLE=</b><i>YES/NO</i>: Indicates whether the
color table should be copied from the seed file.
Only taken into account if SEED is specified.
By default this is NO. <p>

<li> <b>COPY_SEED_FILE_MODEL=</b><i>YES/NO</i>: Indicates whether the
existing models (without their graphic contents) should be copied from the seed file.
This holds as well for the view groups and named views to which they are linked to.
Only taken into account if SEED is specified.
By default this is YES. <p>

<li> <b>COPY_SEED_FILE_MODEL_CONTROL_ELEMENTS=</b><i>YES/NO</i>: Indicates whether the
existing control elements of models should be copied from the seed file.
Only taken into account if COPY_SEED_FILE_MODEL=YES.
By default this is YES. <p>

<li> <b>APPLICATION=</b><i>string</i>: Set Application field in header. If not specified,
derived from seed file when set. Otherwise mentions the version of GDAL and the Teigha
library used.<p>

<li> <b>TITLE=</b><i>string</i>: Set Title field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>SUBJECT=</b><i>string</i>: Set Subject field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>AUTHOR=</b><i>string</i>: Set Author field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>KEYWORDS=</b><i>string</i>: Set Keywords field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>TEMPLATE=</b><i>string</i>: Set Template field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>COMMENTS=</b><i>string</i>: Set Comments field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>LAST_SAVED_BY=</b><i>string</i>: Set LastSavedBy field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>REVISION_NUMBER=</b><i>string</i>: Set RevisionNumber field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>CATEGORY=</b><i>string</i>: Set Category field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>MANAGER=</b><i>string</i>: Set Manager field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>COMPANY=</b><i>string</i>: Set Company field in header. If not specified,
from the seed file.<p>

</ul>

The layer creation supports the following options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>DESCRIPTION=</b><i>string</i>: Description associated with the layer.
If not specified, from the seed file.<p>

<li> <b>DIM=</b><i>2/3</i>: Dimension (ie 2D vs 3D) of the layer. By default, 3,
unless the model is reused from the seed file.<p>

</ul>
