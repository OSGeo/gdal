<h1>IHO S-57 (ENC)</h1>

IHO S-57 datasets are supported for read access.<p>

The S-57 driver module produces features for all S-57 features in 
S-57 file, and associated updates.  S-57 (ENC) files normally have
the extension ".000".<p>

S-57 feature objects are translated into features.  S-57 geometry
objects are automatically collected and formed into geometries on the 
features.<P>

The S-57 reader depends on having two supporting files, s57objectclasses.csv,
and s57attributes.csv available at runtime in order to translate features
in an object class specific manner.  These should be in the directory pointed
to by the environment variable S57_CSV, or in the current working directory.
<p>

S-57 update files contain information on how to update a distributed S-57 
base data file.  The base files normally have the extension .000 while the
update files have extensions like .001, .002 and so on.  The S-57 reader 
will normally read and apply all updates files to the in memory version of
the base file on the fly.  The feature data provided to the application 
therefore includes all the updates. <p>

<h3>Feature Translation</h3>

Normally all features read from S-57 are assigned to a layer based on
the name of the object class (OBJL) to which they belong.  For instance,
with an OBJL value of 2, the feature is an "Airport / airfield" and has
a short name of "AIRARE" which is used as the layer name.  A typical
S-57 transfer will have in excess of 100 layers.<p>

Each feature type has a predefined set of attributes as defined by the
S-57 standard.  For instance, the airport (AIRARE) object class can
have the AIRARE, CATAIR, CONDTN, CONVIS, NOBJNM, OBJNAM, STATUS, INFORM,
NINFOM, NTXTDS, PICREP, SCAMAX, SCAMIN, TXTDSC, ,RECDAT, RECIND, SORDAT,
and SORIND attributes.  These short names can be related to longer, more
meaningful names using an S-57 object/attribute catalog such as the
S-57 standard document itself, or the catalog files (s57attributes.csv,
and s57objectclasses.csv).  
Such a catalog can also be used to establish all the available object classes,
and their attributes.<p>

The following are some common attributes, including generic attributes 
which appear on all feature, regardless of object class.
is turned on. <p>

<pre>
  Attribute Name  Description                            Defined On
  --------------  -----------                            ----------

  GRUP            Group number.			         All features

  OBJL            Object label code.  This number	 All features
	          indicates the object class of the 
                  feature. 

  RVER            Record version.

  AGEN            Numeric agency code, such as 50 for    All features
                  the Canadian Hydrographic Service.
		  A potentially outdated list is 
		  available in agencode.txt.

  FIDN            Feature identification number.         All features

  FIDS            Feature identification subdivision.    All features

  DSNM            Dataset name.  The name of the file    All features
                  the feature came from.  Used with
                  LNAM to form a unique dataset wide
		  identifier for a feature.

  INFORM          Informational text.                    Some features

  NINFOM	  Informational text in national         Some features

  NOBJNM          Object name in national		 Some features
                  language.

The following are present if LNAM_REFS is enabled:
<pre>
  LNAM            Long name.  An encoding of AGEN,       All features
                  FIDN and FIDS used to uniquely 
                  identify this features within an
                  S-57 file.  

  LNAM_REFS       List of long names of related features All Features

  FFPT_RIND       Relationship indicators for each of    All Features
                  the LNAM_REFS relationships. 

</pre>

<h3>Soundings</h3>

Depth soundings are handled somewhat specially in S-57 format, in order
to efficiently represent the many available data points.  In S-57 one
sounding feature can have many sounding points.  The S-57 reader
splits each of these out into it's own feature type `SOUNDG' feature
with an s57_type of `s57_point3d'.  All the soundings from a single
feature record will have the same AGEN, FIDN, FIDS and LNAM value.<p>

<h3>S57 Control Options</h3>

There are several control options which can be used to alter the behavior of
the S-57 reader.  Users can set these by appending them in the 
OGR_S57_OPTIONS environment variable. 
<p>
Starting with GDAL 2.0, they can also be specified independently as open options
to the driver.
<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>UPDATES</b>=APPLY/IGNORE: Should update files be incorporated into the
base data on the fly.  Default is APPLY.<p>

<li> <b>SPLIT_MULTIPOINT</b>=ON/OFF: Should multipoint soundings be split
into many single point sounding features.  Multipoint geometries are not well
handle by many formats, so it can be convenient to split single sounding
features with many points into many single point features.  Default is OFF. <p>

<li> <b>ADD_SOUNDG_DEPTH</b>=ON/OFF: Should a DEPTH attribute be added on
SOUNDG features and assign the depth of the sounding.  This should only be
enabled with SPLIT_MULTIPOINT is also enabled.  
Default is OFF. <p>

<li> <b>RETURN_PRIMITIVES</b>=ON/OFF: Should all the low level geometry 
primitives be returned as special IsolatedNode, ConnectedNode, Edge and
Face layers.  Default is OFF. <p>

<li> <b>PRESERVE_EMPTY_NUMBERS</b>=ON/OFF: If enabled, numeric attributes
assigned an empty string as a value will be preserved as a special numeric
value.  This option should not generally be needed, but may be useful 
when translated S-57 to S-57 losslessly.  Default is OFF. <p>

<li> <b>LNAM_REFS</b>=ON/OFF: Should LNAM and LNAM_REFS fields be 
attached to features capturing the feature to feature relationships in the
FFPT group of the S-57 file.  Default is ON.<p>

<li> <b>RETURN_LINKAGES</b>=ON/OFF: Should additional attributes 
relating features to their underlying geometric primitives be attached.  These
are the values of the FSPT group, and are primarily needed when doing 
S-57 to S-57 translations.  Default is OFF.<p>

<li> <b>RECODE_BY_DSSI</b>=ON/OFF: (OGR &gt;= 1.10) Should attribute values be recoded to UTF-8
from the character encoding specified in the S57 DSSI record. Default is OFF.<p>

</ul>

Example:

<pre>
set OGR_S57_OPTIONS = "RETURN_PRIMITIVES=ON,RETURN_LINKAGES=ON,LNAM_REFS=ON"
</pre>

<h3>S-57 Export</h3>

Preliminary S-57 export capability has been added in GDAL/OGR 1.2.0 but
is intended only for specialized use, and is not properly documented at
this time.  Setting the following options is a minimum required to 
support S-57 to S-57 conversion via OGR.<p>

<pre>
set OGR_S57_OPTIONS = "RETURN_PRIMITIVES=ON,RETURN_LINKAGES=ON,LNAM_REFS=ON"
</pre>

Since GDAL/OGR X.Y.Z, the following dataset creation options are supported to
supply basic information for the S-57 data set descriptive records (DSID and
DSPM, see the S-57 standard for a more detailed description):
