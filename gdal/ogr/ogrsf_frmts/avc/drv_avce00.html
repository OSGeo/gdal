<h1>Arc/Info E00 (ASCII) Coverage</h1>

Arc/Info E00 Coverages (eg. Arc/Info V7 and earlier) are supported by
OGR for read access.  <p>

The label, arc, polygon, centroid, region and text 
sections of a coverage are all supported as layers.  Attributes from INFO
are appended to labels, arcs, polygons or region where appropriate.  When
available the projection information is read and translated.  Polygon 
geometries are collected for polygon and region layers from the composing arcs.
<p>

Text sections are represented as point layers.  Display height is preserved
in the HEIGHT attribute field; however, other information about text 
orientation is discarded.<p>

Info tables associated with a coverage, but not sepecifically named to be
attached to one of the existing geometric layers is currently not accessable
through OGR.  Note that info tables are stored in an 'info' directory at
the same level as the coverage directory.  If this is inaccessable or 
corrupt no info attributes will be appended to coverage layers, but the
geometry should still be accessable.<p>

The layers are named as follows:

<ol>
<li> A label layer (polygon labels, or free standing points) is named
LAB if present. <p>
<li> A centroid layer (polygon centroids) is named CNT if present. <p>
<li> An arc (line) layer is named ARC if present. <p>
<li> A polygon layer is named "PAL" if present.<p>
<li> A text section is named according to the section subclass. <p>
<li> A region subclass is named according to the subclass name. <p>
</ol>

Random (by FID) reads of arcs, and polygons is supported it may not be 
supported for other feature types.  Random ascess to E00 files is generally
slow.<p>
