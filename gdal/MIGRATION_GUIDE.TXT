MIGRATION GUIDE FROM GDAL 1.11 to GDAL 2.0
------------------------------------------

This file documents backwards incompatible changes. You are strongly encouraged
to read the relevant RFCs for details and rationale for those changes.

A) RFC 46: Unification of GDAL and OGR driver models

Link: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc46_gdal_ogr_unification

C++ API:

  * The following methods from OGRSFDriverRegistrar are removed : Open(),
    OpenShared(), ReleaseDataSource(), DeregisterDriver(), AutoLoadDrivers()

  * OGRDataSource::CreateLayer() specialized implementations should be renamed
    as ICreateLayer() to benefit from layer creation options validation.

  * OGRLayer::GetInfo() has been removed.

  * All methods of OGRDataSource have been transfered to GDALDataset, except
    SyncToDisk() that should now be implemented as FlushCache() in drivers.

  * GDALOpenInfo::papszSiblingFiles member is now private. Use the new
    GetSiblingFiles() method instead.

  * GDALOpenInfo::fp member is replaced by fpL member of type VSILFILE*.

  * OGRSFDriver::CopyDataSource() has been removed.

  * GDALDriverManager::GetHome() and SetHome() have been removed.

Out-of-tree drivers :

  * Read RFC 46 for the needed changes. Changes in GDALOpenInfo will impact GDAL
    drivers. GDAL drivers should also declare SetMetadataItem( GDAL_DCAP_RASTER, "YES" ).
    OGRDataSource::CreateLayer() and SyncToDisk() changes will affect OGR drivers.

Behaviour changes :

  * GDALDriverManager::GetDriverCount() and GetDriver() return both raster and
    vector drivers. The nature of a driver can be tested with the GDAL_DCAP_RASTER
    and GDAL_DCAP_VECTOR driver metadata item.

  * GetRefCount() starts at 1 for OGRDataSource instead of 0.

B) RFC 49: Curve geometries

Link: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc49_curve_geometries

C/C++ API :

  * Use of wkb25DBit macro is strongly discouraged, as not compatible with new
    geometry types. Use wkbFlatten(), wkbHasZ(), wkbSetZ() instead
  * OGRwkbGeometryType enumeration has new values.

Behaviour changes :

  * GML, NAS, WFS, PostGIS, VRT, GeoPackage and CSV drivers can return non-linear geometries.
    Applications that do not wish to get such geometries can call
    OGRSetNonLinearGeometriesEnabledFlag(FALSE)

Out-of-tree drivers :

  * Read RFC 49 for the needed changes. CreateFeature() and SetFeature() virtual
    methods must be renamed ICreateFeature() and ISetFeature().

C) RFC 51: RasterIO() improvements : resampling and progress callback

Link: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc51_rasterio_resampling_progress

Out-of-tree drivers :

  * Read RFC 51 for the needed changes. GDALRasterBand and GDALDataset::IRasterIO()
    take a new GDALRasterIOExtraArg* psExtraArg argument.
    GDALRasterBand and GDALDataset::RasterIO() take a new
    GDALRasterIOExtraArg* psExtraArg argument


MIGRATION GUIDE FROM GDAL 1.10 to GDAL 1.11
-------------------------------------------

This file documents backwards incompatible changes.

C++ API:

  * GDALRasterAttributeTable is now an abstract class.
    See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc40_enhanced_rat_support
    The functionnality of GDAL 1.X GDALRasterAttributeTable is now in
    GDALDefaultRasterAttributeTable.

OGR drivers :

  * Due to RFC 41, if a OGR driver calls SetGeomType(wkbNone) on a layer,
    it will be impossible to affect geometries to features of that layer.
    This worked before, although it was inconsistant, but it does no longer now.
    In the developmenet of RFC 41, the CSV and VRT drivers have been upgraded
    to fix such errors.

Changes that should likely not impact anybody :

   * OGRGeometry::exportToGEOS() and OGRGeometryFactory::createFromGEOS() now
     take a GEOSContextHandle_t argument ( GEOS >= 3.1.0 )

   * OGRGeometryFactory::getGEOSGeometryFactory() has been removed.
     This method returned NULL since 2006
     ( http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/9899/trunk/ogr/ogrgeometryfactory.cpp )
