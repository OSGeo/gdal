	Preparing a PROJ.4 Release
	==========================

1) Update the version number in configure.in (in AC_INIT()).

   1a) Update the version number in PROJ_BUILD_VERSION in CMakeLists.txt
   1b) Update the version number in doc/source/conf.py

2) Update the version number in proj_api.h (#define PJ_VERSION).

3) Update the version number, and date in src/pj_release.c.

4) Update the version number in the -version-info definition in
   src/Makefile.am.  It consists of "current:revision:age".  Set
   the same in the PROJ_SOVERSION variable in CMakeLists.txt

   4a) Increment PROJ_BUILD_VERSION in CMakeLists.txt to follow
       libtool versioning

   - If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
     then increment revision (c:r:a becomes c:r+1:a).

   - If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
     update, increment current, and set revision to 0.

   - If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
     increment age.

   - If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then
     set age to 0.

4.5) Run "autogen.sh" (hopefully on the same machine it was last run on)

5) Add a note to the ChangeLog that a new release is being issued, and what
   the release number is.

6) Update NEWS file with summary of release changes.

7) Update the proj.spec file for the new version:
    - PACKAGE_VERSION
    - Source0
    - %setup line
    - rm -rf line

8) If this is a major release, prepare a branch.

   svn copy https://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj/trunk \
            https://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj/branches/4.7

9) Tag the release set in SVN

   svn copy https://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj/branches/4.7 \
            https://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj/tags/4.7.0

10) Do a "make dist-all" in the proj root directory.  After some grinding
   this should result in files like proj-4.4.3.tar.gz and proj-4.4.3.zip
   being created.  These are full source distributions.

11) Put these in the proj ftp area on /osgeo/download/proj on
   download.osgeo.org.  This can be done via scp using a command like the
   following.

  scp proj-4.4.3.{tar.gz,zip} warmerdam@download.osgeo.org:/osgeo/download/proj

12) Announce the new release on the PROJ.4 and MetaCRS mailing lists.

13) Issue a new release report on Freshmeat.

   http://freshmeat.net/projects/proj.4/

NOTES:

 o Information about preparing binary releases, and RPMs should be formalized.
 o A "beta" release step should likely be incorporated.
