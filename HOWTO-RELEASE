	Notes on Preparing a GDAL Source Release
	========================================


Prerequisites:

1) Check that the release is ready to go as far as ABI (binary compatibility)
   is concerned. This can be checked by comparing the installed headers of the
   candidate release with the installed headers of the previous release 
   (diff -ur $(OLD_INSTALL_DIR)/include $(NEW_INSTALL_DIR)/include). The API
   is defined as all functions and classes exported by the CPL_DLL keyword.

  - For major and minor releases, there must be no function signature change
    for the C API. Only new functions are allowed.

  - For major releases, the allowed changes in C++ API should (or must?) be 
    such that user calling C++ code can still compile against new headers 
    without modification (existing methods can become virtual, default 
    arguments can be added, new methods or members can be added)

  - For minor releases (1.6.1 versus 1.6.0), the C++ ABI stability must be
    preserved : no method signature change, no addition of virtual methods, no
    new members. Only non-virtual methods can be added.

Process :

1) a) Regenerate configure using autogen.sh and commit if changed.
   b) Regenerate swig generated files for python bindings and commit if changed.

   There is often a reference system on which this should be done (ie. Frank's
   dev workstation) to avoid unnecessary churn from different autoconf or swig
   versions.

2) Update the release date, and number information in gcore/gdal_version.h.

3) Update the VERSION file. Update ./swig/python/setup.py version information. 
   Update ./swig/include/perl/gdal_perl.i $VERSION string to current version.

3.5) For major releases update the VERSION macro in nmake.opt (for 1.6, 1.7etc)

4) Update LIBGDAL_CURRENT/REVISION/AGE macros in GDALmake.opt.in.
   - For a release with no interface changes just bump REVISION. 
   - Adding interfaces, bump CURRENT/AGE, set REVISION to 0. 
   - Deleting interfaces / compatibility issues - bump CURRENT, others to zero.

5) Prepare release overview in the NEWS file.  The Trac revision log for
   trunk or the stable branch can be helpful.

    http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/log/branches/1.4

  - commit new version to NEWS file.

6) Update the GDAL http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource topic to 
   refer to the latest available source. 
   Update http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki (Releases section)
   Update http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/NewsAndStatus

7) If this is a major release, prepare a branch. 

   svn copy https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk \
            https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/branches/1.5

8) Tag the release set in CVS: 

   svn copy https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/branches/1.4 \
            https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/tags/1.4.1

9) Create the source distributions using the mkgdaldist.sh script.  The
   argument should be the version number (ie. 1.4.1). 

   eg.
   % mkgdaldist.sh 1.4.0

   or
 
   % mkgdaldist.sh 1.4.2 -branch tags/1.4.2

10) Create a snapshot of the documentation.

 ie. On www.gdal.org:
 % cd /osgeo/gdal
 % ./gdalhtmlupdate.sh
 % zip -r /osgeo/download/gdal/gdal150doc.zip gdal-web/*.* gdal-web/ogr

11) Create a snapshot of autotest suite:

  svn export http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/branches/1.6/autotest gdalautotest-1.6.0
  tar czvf gdalautotest-1.6.0.tar.gz gdalautotest-1.6.0
  zip -r gdalautotest-1.6.0.zip gdalautotest-1.6.0

11.5) If changes have been made in the frmts/grass or ogr/ogrsf_frmts/grass dir,
      generate an up-to-date gdal-grass snapshot (let's not forget do it for GDAL 1.7.0 !):

  % cd frmts/grass
  % make dist

12) Publish the resulting files in download.osgeo.org/gdal.

13) Announce release to the gdal-dev@lists.maptools.org, 
   gdal-announce@lists.osgeo.org, freegis@freegis.org and news_item@osgeo.org. 

14) Update the freshmeat.net entry for GDAL. 

15) Update the freegis.org entry for GDAL.

16) Update doc/index.dox to advertize the new release and link to the release notes

17) Create a News page in Trac for the release (like 
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/Release/1.7.0-News) and reference it from
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ (Releases) and 
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/NewsAndStatus .

18) Add pointers to the source releases at:
  
  http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource
