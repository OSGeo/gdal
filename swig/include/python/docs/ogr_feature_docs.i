    feature will adhere.

Destroy feature.

The feature is deleted, but within the context of the GDAL/OGR heap.

DLL and they want to delete a feature created within the DLL. If the
delete is done in the calling application the memory will be freed
onto the application heap which is inappropriate.

Test if two features are the same.

Two features are considered equal if the share them (handle equality)
same OGRFeatureDefn, have the same field values, and the same geometry
(as tested by OGR_G_Equal()) as well as the same feature id.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::Equal().

Parameters
-----------

%feature("docstring")  SetFrom "OGRErr OGR_F_SetFrom(OGRFeatureH
hFeat, OGRFeatureH hOtherFeat, int bForgiving)

Set one feature from another.

Overwrite the contents of this feature from the geometry and
attributes of another. The hOtherFeature does not need to have the
same OGRFeatureDefn. Field values are copied by corresponding field
names. Field types do not have to exactly match. OGR_F_SetField\\*()
function conversion rules will be applied as needed.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetFrom().

Parameters
-----------
hFeat:
    handle to the feature to set to.
hOtherFeat:
    handle to the feature from which geometry, and field
    values will be copied.
bForgiving:
    TRUE if the operation should continue despite lacking
    output fields matching some of the source fields.

Returns
--------

";

%feature("docstring")  SetFromWithMap "OGRErr
OGR_F_SetFromWithMap(OGRFeatureH hFeat, OGRFeatureH hOtherFeat, int
bForgiving, const int \\*panMap)

Set one feature from another.

Overwrite the contents of this feature from the geometry and
attributes of another. The hOtherFeature does not need to have the
same OGRFeatureDefn. Field values are copied according to the provided
indices map. Field types do not have to exactly match.
OGR_F_SetField\\*() function conversion rules will be applied as needed.
This is more efficient than OGR_F_SetFrom() in that this doesn't
lookup the fields by their names. Particularly useful when the field
names don't match.

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::SetFrom().

Parameters
-----------
hFeat:
    handle to the feature to set to.
hOtherFeat:
    handle to the feature from which geometry, and field
    values will be copied.
panMap:
    Array of the indices of the destination feature's fields
    stored at the corresponding index of the source feature's fields. A
    value of -1 should be used to ignore the source's field. The array
    should not be NULL and be as long as the number of fields in the
    source feature.
bForgiving:
    TRUE if the operation should continue despite lacking
    output fields matching some of the source fields.

Returns
--------
OGRErr:
    OGRERR_NONE if the operation succeeds, even if some values are not
    transferred, otherwise an error code.

that it does not assume ownership of the passed string, but instead
makes a copy of it.

This function is the same as the C++ method

%feature("docstring")  Validate "int OGR_F_Validate(OGRFeatureH
hFeat, int nValidateFlags, int bEmitError)

Validate that a feature meets constraints of its schema.

The scope of test is specified with the nValidateFlags parameter.

Regarding OGR_F_VAL_WIDTH, the test is done assuming the string width
must be interpreted as the number of UTF-8 characters. Some drivers
might interpret the width as the number of bytes instead. So this test
is rather conservative (if it fails, then it will fail for all
interpretations).

This function is the same as the C++ method OGRFeature::Validate().

.. versionadded:: 2.0

Parameters
-----------
hFeat:
    handle to the feature to validate.
nValidateFlags:
    OGR_F_VAL_ALL or combination of OGR_F_VAL_NULL,
    OGR_F_VAL_GEOM_TYPE, OGR_F_VAL_WIDTH and
    OGR_F_VAL_ALLOW_NULL_WHEN_DEFAULT with '|' operator

    TRUE if a CPLError() must be emitted when a check fails

Returns
-------
int:
    TRUE if all enabled validation tests pass.
";

%feature("docstring")  GetNativeData "const char\\*
OGR_F_GetNativeData(OGRFeatureH hFeat)

Returns the native data for the feature.

The native data is the representation in a \"natural\" form that comes
from the driver that created this feature, or that is aimed at an
output driver. The native data may be in different format, which is
indicated by OGR_F_GetNativeMediaType().

Note that most drivers do not support storing the native data in the
feature object, and if they do, generally the NATIVE_DATA open option
must be passed at dataset opening.

The \"native data\" does not imply it is something more performant or
powerful than what can be obtained with the rest of the API, but it
may be useful in round-tripping scenarios where some characteristics
of the underlying format are not captured otherwise by the OGR
abstraction.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRFeature::GetNativeData().
