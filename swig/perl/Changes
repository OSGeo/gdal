2.1 <release date here>
  [Enhancements/changes in the API]
  * The output from a GDAL driver can be redirected to a write method
    of a class.
  * The methods of Geo::GDAL::VSIF (the GDAL file system wrapper) can
    be imported.
  * New methods in Dataset: ComputeColorTable, Dither, DEMProcessing,
    Grid, Info, Nearblack, Rasterize, Translate, Warp, Warped.
  * New methods in Band: Distance Polygonize and Sieve
  * New methods in Dataset: ReadTile and WriteTile, these return
    arrays with three dimensions
  * ReadTile and WriteTile methods (Band, Dataset) now accept tile
    size and resampling algorithm
  * The GDAL XML API has been put into a new class Geo::GDAL::XML. The
    old API is still there (like for many other enhancements), it is
    just removed from the documentation to clean up the API of the
    class Geo::GDAL.
  * Geo::OGR::Driver and Geo::OGR::DataSource are now pure Perl
    interfaces to GDAL classes, which do the actual work. This should
    have been done in 2.0, which merged vector and raster driver and
    dataset classes. Geo::OGR::Driver is needed for opening, creating,
    and copying vector datasets but Geo::OGR::DataSource is just a
    legacy class.
  * New pure Perl class Geo::GDAL::Extent, which is an array [xmin,
    ymin, xmax, ymax] to ease some tasks
  * A new API for GDAL error messages. All errors that are emitted in
    GDAL during the execution of a call are stored in a stack (array)
    in Geo::GDAL. The error stack (possibly a multiline string) can be
    retrieved using the subroutine Geo::GDAL::errstr, which also
    clears the stack.
  * The named parameter calling system has been integrated into one
    subroutine in the bindings, which unifies its behavior. The named
    parameters capability has been added to some methods.
  * All errors which are not emitted by Perl or by Swig are now
    confessed (the stack trace is included), even those that happen
    within the typemaps (C code between Perl and Swig interface).
  * The bindings now require at least Perl 5.10, at least for the null
    coalescing operator.
  * File::Share can now be used to obtain a file containing the path
    to GDAL support files.
  * Add support for 64bit integers if the OS supports them.

  [Bug fixes]
  * Fix memory leak: CSLAdd* functions copy the parameter string.
  * Fix the use of EXTEND. Returning large arrays caused core dumps.
  * Perl bindings have GintBig, so the 64bit versions should be used.
  * Review of parent - child relationships and their management
  * Fix a bug in Layer DESTROY.
  * Fix Geotransform::FromGCPs and typemap for GCP array input. Add
    tests for these.
  * Fix sending utf8 from Perl to GDAL. Should also remove some
    "uninitialized value" warnings.
  * Fix a bug in Dataset->SpatialReference.
  * Fix tests which fail if Perl uses longdouble.
  * The shadow feature was not working for Feature class. Bugfix for
    Geo::OGR::Feature->new().
  * Fix #6050: string formatting in croak.
  * Fix #6039 use standard C comments in swig bindings.

  [Other things]
  * Many Documentation enhancements and fixes.
  * Many new tests.
  * Enhancements to Makefile.PL for independent builds & automatic tests.
  * Add basic POD to GDAL.pm to make this module look nice in metacpan.
  * Edit Makefile.PL due to rt.cpan.org requests 91636 and 107023.
  * Perl Makefile.PL: add support for all hardening buildflags (patch
    by Bas Couwenberg, #5998).
