Questions should go to the gdal-dev mailing list (https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/gdal-dev)
or other support forums. GitHub issues are for bug reports and suggestions
for new features.

The GDAL project is made of contributions from various individuals and organizations,
each with their own focus. The issue you are facing is not necessarily in the
priority list of those contributors and consequently there is no guarantee that it will be
adressed in a timely manner.
If this bug report or feature request is high-priority for you, we suggest
engaging a GDAL developer or support organisation and financially sponsoring a fix.
