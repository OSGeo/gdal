  - name: '"pip install GDAL" does not work'

    about: >
      "pip install GDAL" only works if you have the development headers and
      library of the native libgdal matching the version of the GDAL python
      bindings you want to install. Which may not be easily found, in particular
      on Windows. We do not consider the lack of pip binary wheels as a defect.
      Our best suggestion is to recommend using GDAL Conda builds instead as
      documented at https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html#conda
