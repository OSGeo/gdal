Make sure that the title of your commit(s) is descriptive. Typically, they
should be formatted as "component/filename: Describe what the commit does (fixes #ticket)",
so that anyone that parses 'git log' immediately knows what a commit is about.
Do not hesitate to provide more context in the longer part of the commit message.

GOOD: "GTiff: fix wrong color interpretation with -co ALPHA=YES (fixes #1234)

When -co ALPHA=YES was used, but PHOTOMETRIC was not specified, the ExtraSample
tag was wrongly set to unspecified.
"

BAD: "Fix crash", "fix #1234"

In case you need several iterations to make continuous integration happy,
