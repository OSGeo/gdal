+# Cf https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/8926
+# The above build_ext has been run with numpy already installed in the environment
+# because otherwise it would have failed.
+# But as we run pip install without dependencies, we have to force
+# GDAL_PYTHON_BINDINGS_WITHOUT_NUMPY=YES to disable the related check.
+# This is OK here since the bindings have already been built, and it is just
+# a matter of bundling them in the wheel.
