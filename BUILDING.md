# GDAL build instructions

This file contains and points to instructions about building GDAL from source.

# Building with cmake

There is a [build hints](https://gdal.org/build_hints.html) page on the website.

Beyond that page, note:
  - cmake builds in the source directory are not supported (expected to fail)

# Building with autoconf

Building with autoconf is deprecated.  While there are many --with
options, the build system mostly follows autoconf norms.
